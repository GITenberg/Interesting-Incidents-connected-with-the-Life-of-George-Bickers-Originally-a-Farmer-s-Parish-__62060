<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> writer of these pages was born at
Laxfield, a village in the County of Suffolk, on the 16th day of
January, 1809, the forty-eighth year of our good King George the
Third&rsquo;s happy reign.&nbsp; That eventful day was to me the
commencement of a long and sometimes tedious journey: oftimes I
have had to encounter great perils and dangers, but out of all
the Lord hath delivered me.</p>
<p>That eventful day witnessed the closing career of a great
British General, Sir John Moore, at Corunna, a seaport of Spain,
whither he had gone to take the command of the English forces, in
order, if possible, to relieve that unhappy country, then being
sorely harassed by the armies of Napoleon I., under the command
of the Duke of Dalmatia (Marshall Soult), but the campaign proved
a failure, resulting in the death of the Commander-in-Chief, and
the re-embarkation of the troops, with a loss of about eight
hundred of our countrymen, Soult being more than a match for the
valour of British arms on that memorable and trying
occasion.&nbsp; But France was destined to be humbled, and six
years later on, Napoleon and his generals felt the weight of
British prowess at Waterloo.</p>
<p>I was the second son of my parents, Benjamin and Charlotte,
poor, but industrious people, my father being an agricultural
labourer: and, having but a slender income, yet felt a wish their
children should acquire a little education, which might prove
useful to them in their future stations in life under which they
might be called.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>When
about four years of age, while one day playing in the road with
other children, near my father&rsquo;s cottage, there happened to
be a horse, belonging to a miller of the name of Heffer, quietly
feeding.&nbsp; Being then (as since) very forward in mischief, I
threw my cap at the quiet creature, and then must needs go too
near its heels to pick it up; the sad consequence was I was
kicked on the head, and my right eye nearly perished, but, under
the skilful treatment of Mr. Alling, a surgeon in the village, my
eyesight was preserved, and, although I am writing more than
sixty years later on, yet the scar still remains, and also the
seam in the bone is still perceptible.&nbsp; But what of the poor
horse?&nbsp; He came to grief very soon after, as one day being
loose in the stable, and the master, going in to take him some
food, omitted to shut the door, the horse ran out, and, before
the man could recover him, he was struck by one of the sails of
the windmill, and was killed thereby.&nbsp; This accident
reminded the owner of that dangerous machine that it would be
much better to raise it higher, which was soon after
accomplished.&nbsp; And, perhaps, I may be permitted to observe
that, by the kind care of a watchful and loving Jehovah, my life
was preserved; and, in looking back, can praise the Lord for His
goodness, and for the care extended unto me at this, the
beginning of my journey of a long life.</p>
<p>The time had now arrived when school must be attended, and my
first schoolmaster was Mr. Benjamin Chenery, at that time clerk
and sexton of the parish, and was no ways sparing of the heads
and backs of his pupils, but we hope, on the whole, he followed a
rightful course, for he had in his vocation many grave and solemn
duties to perform, both as to the interment of the aged, as also
the education and training of the young.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Under the
care and tuition of Benjamin, I first learned to read, to write
upon a slate, and do little sums, after having mastered the
figures.&nbsp; Easy spelling also came on, as a matter of course;
and there was no lack of errands to perform, as well for the
mistress as the master, and I occasionally assisted in sweeping
up the church, the chancel being occupied as a schoolroom during
the summer season, when fire was not needed, as the master was
not usually at a loss to supply a warming.</p>
<p>The churchyard, too spacious as it was, proved a most
excellent playground; there were plain spaces for marbles and
tops, piers and buttresses for hide-and-seek; graves, and stones,
and tombs, to jump over and jump from, without any restriction,
and readily did we unite in these healthful exercises, however
dangerous or mischievous they might be in other respects.</p>
<p>There was another school near, kept by Mr. John Goodwin; the
pupils were more advanced, some being farmers&rsquo; sons.&nbsp;
That being a free school, yet the master was allowed to take
private pupils.&nbsp; Females, also, were instructed, having a
room to themselves opposite the master&rsquo;s desk, called the
&ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boys at those schools
were not allowed to play together, the smaller ones possessing
the protection of the sacred enclosure, which was at the larger
ones&rsquo; peril to invade.&nbsp; We could see them at their
play, as we looked through the openings of the gate; and there
was sometimes displayed a germ of hostility among the youthful
students.</p>
<p>In attending this school I was taught to read, and also easy
spelling, as before observed; then came little sums in addition,
subtraction, and multiplication.&nbsp; I soon became able to read
in class; we daily read the Psalms from the book of Common
Prayer.&nbsp; We <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>did not have bible reading at this school, as many
families at that time did not possess the sacred volume, my
parents being among that number; but our immediate neighbours
were in possession of a bible, and were always willing to lend it
to my parents of an evening, and the owners, being aged people,
would often invite me to stand and read to them from their bible,
of Adam and Eve, of Noah, of Abraham, and Lot, of Isaac and
Jacob, and also that remarkable narrative of Joseph and his
brethren.&nbsp; These exercises were to me helps in the right
direction.&nbsp; My master found I was getting on, and set me to
read to him pieces from history, principally from
Goldsmith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
closing paragraph of the 7th chapter I will here insert, because,
although more than sixty years have rolled away, yet I well
remember the concluding sentences.&nbsp; Here is a
sample:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My wife now kept up the conversation,
though not the argument.&nbsp; She observed that several prudent
men of our acquaintance were freethinkers, and made very good
husbands.&nbsp; And she knew some sensible girls that had skill
enough to make converts of their spouses.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who
knows, my dear,&rsquo; continued she, &lsquo;what Olivia may be
able to do?&nbsp; The girl has a great deal to say upon every
subject, and to my knowledge is very skilled in
controversy.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, my dear, what controversy
can she have read?&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It does not occur
to me that I have ever put such books into her hands; you
certainly overrate her merit.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed,
papa,&rsquo; replied Olivia, &lsquo;she does not.&nbsp; I have
read a great deal of controversy.&nbsp; I have the disputes
between Thwackum and Square, the controversy between Robinson
Crusoe and Friday, the savage, and I am now employed in reading
the controversy in &lsquo;Religious
Courtship.&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I cried
I, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a good girl; I find you are perfectly
qualified for making converts, and so go help your mother to make
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the
gooseberry-pie.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the master added, &ldquo;you shall have a piece
<i>on&rsquo;t</i>, mister, when it be enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had
wondered a hundred times in what book the above passage could be
found.&nbsp; At length the discovery was made, and now the
concluding portion of the 17th chapter, together with the
verses&mdash;six of them&mdash;have passed through my mind, in
the absence of something better, a great many times:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was within about four days of her
(Olivia&rsquo;s) intended nuptials that my little family, at
night, were gathered around a charming fire, telling stories of
the past, and laying schemes for the future, busied in forming a
thousand projects, and laughing at whatever folly came
uppermost.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, Moses, my boy, we shall soon
have a wedding in our family; what is your opinion of matters and
things in general?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My opinion is, father,
that all things go on very well, and I was just now thinking that
when sister Livy is married to Farmer Williams, we shall then
have the loan of his cider-press and brewing tubs for
nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That we shall, Moses,&rsquo; cried
I, &lsquo;and he will sing us &lsquo;<i>Death</i> and the
<i>Lady</i>&rsquo; to raise our spirits into the
bargain.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He has taught that song to our
Dick,&rsquo; cried Moses, &lsquo;and I think he goes through it
very prettily.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Does he so?&rsquo; cried I,
&lsquo;then let&rsquo;s have it.&nbsp; Where is little
Dick?&nbsp; Let him up with it boldly.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My
brother Dick,&rsquo; cried Bill, my youngest, &lsquo;is just gone
out with sister Livy, but Mr. Williams has taught me two songs,
and I&rsquo;ll sing them for you, papa.&nbsp; Which song do you
choose, &lsquo;The Dying Swan,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Elegy on the
Death of a Mad Dog?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The elegy, child, by all
means,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never heard that yet, and
Deborah, my life, grief you know is dry; let us have a bottle of
the best gooseberry wine to keep up our spirits.&nbsp; I have
wept so much at all sorts of late that, without an enlivening
glass, I am sure this would overcome me, and Sophy, love, take
your guitar, and thrum in with the boy a little.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>This is
then the sample of the taste of a master store the mind of a
young scholar; but we must have the &ldquo;Elegy on the Death of
a Mad Dog:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE ELEGY, ETC.</p>
<p>Good people all, of every sort, give ear unto my song,<br />
And if you find it won&rsquo;drous short, it cannot hold you
long.<br />
In Islington there was a man, of whom the world might say<br />
That still a godly race he ran whene&rsquo;er he went to
pray.</p>
<p>A kind and gentle heart he had, to comfort friend and foe,<br
/>
The naked every day he clad, when he put on his clothes;<br />
And in that town a dog was found, as dogs there many be,<br />
Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound, and curs of low
degree.</p>
<p>This dog and man at first were friends, but when a pique
began,<br />
The dog, to gain some private ends, went mad and bit the man;<br
/>
Around, from all the neighbo&rsquo;ring streets, the
wond&rsquo;ring neighbours ran,<br />
And swore the dog had lost his wits to bite so good a man.</p>
<p>The wound it seemed both sore and sad to every Christian
eye,<br />
And while they said the dog was mad, they said the man would
die;<br />
But soon a wonder came to light, that showed the rogues they
lied,<br />
The man recovered of the bite&mdash;the dog it was that died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The master did not attempt to enlighten me.&nbsp; At the close
of the elegy, he merely observed as approval, &ldquo;Oh, the dog
died, did he, mister?&rdquo;&nbsp; But no doubt Oliver Goldsmith
could see something underlying its surface, as there were then
political dogs in Islington, whose virulent bites were very
painful; surely also, are there to be found elsewhere in our
day.</p>
<p>My neighbours were farmers on a small scale: they had a son to
whom I was much attached.&nbsp; They kept several cows, and a
horse named Depper.&nbsp; She was a useful creature, having
carried me many miles.&nbsp; I could spend many half-days with
Depper, instead of being at school, and I believe those in charge
liked my company, so that the time passed away.&nbsp; I had often
little jobs to perform for the old people <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>which sometimes
brought me a meal of good food; at other times a good
farmer&rsquo;s cake, which was always a luxury; and I had charge
of the cows when they were fed in the lanes and roads.&nbsp; This
brought a few pence to my parents, so much needed in those days
of low wages&mdash;about eight or nine shillings per week when
labourers made full time.</p>
<p>It would have been a curious sight in our day, as then, to see
the old couple mounted upon Depper&rsquo;s back, when they were
going out to see friends.&nbsp; A light cart was a scarce article
in those days with small occupiers (my neighbours had only a
tumbril as a carriage); an appliance called a pillion was
fastened upon the rump of the horse, and secured to the saddle,
the greatest difficulty being to mount and dismount; but that
difficulty was overcome.</p>
<p>I have not yet done with my old friend Benjamin; perhaps he
did not trouble about my being absent for a week or two, if I did
not return a bigger dunce.&nbsp; He usually had some of that
class to try his patience.&nbsp; He appointed me many jobs, more
to my mind than studying in the school.&nbsp; The town clock
required to be wound up, the dial of which was at an elevation of
about fifty feet, adorning the south side of the old tower, with
its four neat pinnacles.&nbsp; I was appointed often to wind up
the weights of that clock: the larger weight requiring the power
of two boys, with a crank as large as a grindstone.&nbsp; Then,
again, at funerals, the master would set me to toll the church
bell, the rope being so fixed upon its tongue that an easy jerk
would cause it to strike against the bell&rsquo;s side,
instructions being given that when the procession arrived, and at
a signal from the master, ten strokes were to be given in quick
succession, and then immediately to cease.&nbsp; Then, again,
after the funeral service was over, the grave had to be filled in
by willing hands, which was after a time accomplished, the <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>implements
being afterwards stowed away, and thus ended the school service
of another day.</p>
<p>Four schoolboys were usually selected to convey the funeral
bier to the late residence of the deceased, sometimes half-a-mile
or more distant.&nbsp; Regardless of the solemnity of the
occasion, we enjoyed the outing, and were not in a very great
hurry to return to our studies; and perhaps the master did not
trouble that we should, for I do not remember to have heard him
express much sorrow or inconvenience respecting the
absentees.</p>
<p>I continued to attend Benjamin&rsquo;s school until I was
about ten years of age; at that time my parents thought they
would like me to attend the larger school, that my education
might be forwarded thereby.&nbsp; I learnt the inscription on the
fly-leaf of master&rsquo;s book, which I had often read
through.&nbsp; I could not remember the title.&nbsp; The lines
were these:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whose book I am, if you wish to know,<br />
By letters two I will you show;<br />
The first is B, to all men&rsquo;s sight,<br />
The next is C, to spell it right;<br />
But if you chance to spell amiss,<br />
Look underneath, and here it is:</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Benjamin
Chenery</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farewell! to my first schoolmaster, and gooseberry-pie
book.</p>
<p>It was not very long before a vacancy occurred in the larger
school, and I was elected to fill up the gap.&nbsp; I felt
somewhat timid, but that soon wore off.&nbsp; I was placed at a
desk with others, and had soon to go in for sums in
earnest.&nbsp; All had to be worked out on a slate, and, when
passed as correct, had to be set down in a book.&nbsp; This was
our morning work; afternoon we had Bible-reading in class,
spelling, and afterwards writing with ink in copy book.&nbsp;
There was a very <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>patient usher of the name of George Bilney; but he was
not there long after I joined the school.&nbsp; The discipline
here was more stringent; each free scholar had to wear a badge of
distinction, a school cap, to be worn every Sunday, and to be
present at church, two seats being set apart for the boys of this
school, under the supervision of the master and his usher; and
all absentees had to give a satisfactory account on Monday
mornings of the why&rsquo;s and the wherefore&rsquo;s, or feel
the weight of the cane in the master&rsquo;s hand, however
distasteful it might be.</p>
<p>At this school I made progress; we were allowed to use
&ldquo;Walkingame&rsquo;s Tutor&rsquo;s Assistant;&rdquo; a great
deal could be learnt from this useful work.&nbsp; Said tables on
Fridays, and also Church Catechism, with hard and difficult
spelling at the close thereof, and the first three boys were
rewarded with a ticket each.&nbsp; Often heavy tasks were awarded
for disobedience, and, altogether, the general routine was one of
forced vigilance, obedience, and activity, as no trifling was
permitted during school hours.</p>
<p>After a few months my being in this school, Mr. Bilney, the
usher left, and his place was subsequently filled by Mr. Benjamin
Moulton, who afterwards followed the occupation of an auctioneer
and valuer, at Woodbridge, in this county.&nbsp; I wrote to that
gentleman in 1878, enquiring if he was the same B. M. whom I had
previously known at Mr. Goodwin&rsquo;s school.&nbsp; He returned
an answer, thanking me for the enquiry, that he was the same;
that he was now about seventy years of age; that his health was
fair; and that there was at least one of the old scholars who had
thought about him; but said, also, he never much liked the
situation, so he did not much regret leaving the village and its
associations.</p>
<p>I attended at this school about one year and a half.&nbsp;
There were a better class of pupils (farmer&rsquo;s sons) on <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the
Opposition benches, who were instructed in the higher rudiments,
such as land surveying, mapping, printing, English grammar.&nbsp;
&ldquo;English Reader,&rdquo; &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Speaker&rdquo; were books not prohibited to the free boys,
and, for one, I was very fond of reading them at every
opportunity, for we had the range of the school from twelve
o&rsquo;clock till two, when all could play outside in fine
weather very comfortably together, regardless of station in life,
as two in the same school were my future young masters.</p>
<p>I continued to improve in the acquisition of knowledge, as
there taught, from Multiplication of Integers to Money, and so
on, as in subsequent rules; Division short and long, Reduction,
Practice, and &ldquo;Rule of Three,&rdquo; all requiring close
attention to bring a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; mark, implying the
approval of the master or usher before any sum was allowed to be
entered in the book, and even that was a tedious operation.&nbsp;
There must be no mistakes, no blots, nor any smearing on the
surface; when the master came round, the cane accompanied him,
and sad woes were inflicted on the careless, which were not soon
forgotten.</p>
<p>But it came to be desired that I should begin to work more
closely, and earn my support, for most likely it was thought that
a little help in that direction was, no doubt, very needful, and
being a final decision, I left the school in that eventful year,
1820, and forthwith I soon found my destiny was &ldquo;buckle to
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have said &ldquo;eventful&rdquo; year, in
proof whereof here is an extract from the <i>Evangelical
Magazine</i> of that year:&mdash;&ldquo;George III. died at
Windsor Castle, on the 29th January, 1820 in his 82nd year.&nbsp;
His son, the Duke of Kent, expired a few days previous, at
Sidmouth, in Devonshire, in the 53rd year of his age, leaving an
infant daughter&mdash;our good and virtuous Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Long may she reign.</p>
<p>The way is now apparently open for the Prince <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Regent to
occupy the throne, but the perplexing domestic troubles occupied
the lawyers and barristers more than twelve months ere the ground
could be anything like cleared; but the road in which I was
destined to travel was not so mystified.&nbsp; A master was found
for me, in the person of Mr. Simon Smyth, of Ubbeston,
farmer.&nbsp; I was employed in hoeing, weeding corn, picking
grass, and such-like jobs.&nbsp; I was there ten weeks, or about
half that summer, and more happy was I than the Prince
Regent.&nbsp; My next master was Mr. Robert Scace, of Laxfield,
farmer, and was employed, first keeping sheep, then working in
the hay field, and other odd jobs which might present themselves
to my notice.&nbsp; I got on nicely with Mr. Scace, and after the
hay season was told that I might continue on, and board in the
house during the harvest, and have the same amount of money
weekly.&nbsp; I was glad to hear that, and never found it a
source of regret to anyone.&nbsp; Those were cheerful seasons to
both men and boys, and for my own part I felt that I was advanced
to a post of honour when entrusted with the commands of a horse
or two, and was no longer compelled to go about the fields
gleaning, which occupation I so much disliked.&nbsp; There was
but one son in this family, but he had to work in harvest-time,
and bend down with the sickle, as with that instrument the
wheat-crop was reaped in those days, and it was my lot to assist
Master Robert, when he sought a little rest.&nbsp; He was a
little older than myself, being born in 1806.&nbsp; He lived near
my parents&rsquo; dwelling, and I was often allowed to play with
him before we began to work.&nbsp; His was but a short
course.&nbsp; I have since read in Laxfield Churchyard, near the
porch, upon a stone, this inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Robert Bullock Scace</span>,<br />
Born September 17th, 1806;<br />
Died March 30th, 1853.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>How
quickly the four dozen years passed away!</p>
<p>The joyful harvest being completed, it was arranged that I
should be further detained to keep pigs and other stock in the
fields from off which the corn had been taken.&nbsp; This
employment I was engaged in for several weeks, being always
supplied with a good dinner on each Sunday, sent to the field
from the farmer&rsquo;s table, which was very much enjoyed and
welcomed, these and such-like comforts which came to me on the
Day of Rest.</p>
<p>I know not how long I might have continued here, but
Michaelmas drew on, and it was agreed that I should go into
service, at a farm-house in the parish.&nbsp; This did not give
to me at first a very favourable impression, but undoubtedly it
was the right way into a &ldquo;city of habitation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thenceforth, on the 11th day of October, 1820.&nbsp; I was
received into the family of Mr. John Garrard, of Laxfield, to be
trained and disciplined as a veritable farmer&rsquo;s boy, and
held myself ready to obey any instructions and orders that might
be presented.&nbsp; My training commenced, I did not at all
dislike my new acquaintances, and after a few days felt quite at
home in my new position.&nbsp; There was plenty of work, plenty
of food, and a goodly supply of company.</p>
<p>The family consisted of the master, mistress, four sons, and
five daughters.&nbsp; There were also a man-servant, a maid
servant, and myself.&nbsp; Later on there came into the family a
nephew, who was called Jonathan, and frequently the master called
him &ldquo;Jonter.&rdquo;&nbsp; His father was brother to the
master, and having died April 22nd, 1811, aged 29 years, left him
and a sister to the frowns of an ungodly world, as also to the
care of their mother, who removed from Laxfield, to a place
called Hartley Row, in the county of Hants, there to revive old
associations or to form new ones, and in those engagements it did
seem <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Jonathan could be spared from his mother, then being
about sixteen years of age when he came to live with his
uncle.</p>
<p>As regards myself, my business was to do what every one of the
others left undone, and bear the blame for all; but was so far
favoured, there was a standing rule that no stripes were to be
administered but by the hands of the master, so that, on the
whole, amongst bulls and cows, pigs and sows, children and
chickens, and other bipeds, and quadrupeds, I was not very
lonely, and sometimes felt, after having to endure some pain and
privation, occasioned by the terrible sharp wintry storms that
prevailed, I could go on my way rejoicing.</p>
<p>Things went on, as far as I could observe, pretty easy.&nbsp;
The establishment was a hive of industry; all that were able must
work, and good it was for us to be superintended by a good and
careful master and mistress.&nbsp; About this time, the eldest
son, John, was married, and left us.&nbsp; The second son,
George, was bound apprentice to Mr. Kent, of Beetles, a brazier
and tin-plate worker.&nbsp; The maid-servant was discharged at
the next coming Michaelmas, and I had to learn to milk the cows,
and carry the milk into the dairy, and empty it into the places
assigned for its reception.&nbsp; Two of the daughters, Emma and
Caroline, were now requested to assist their mother in the duties
of the house, while the three youngest daughters and youngest
son, Jesse, were continued at school, so being prepared to occupy
the vacant places when the elder ones left.</p>
<p>But we must have a word or two respecting the new king, George
IV.&nbsp; He had been so proclaimed in London and the provinces,
but by reason of unhappy differences subsisting between the king
and his royal consort, a fixed aversion and a formal separation
had taken place.&nbsp; He had ordered her name to be struck off
the Liturgy when Princess of Wales!</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>It was
said she had raised a favourite Italian, in her employ, from an
humble station, to one of honour; had instituted a new order of
knighthood called the Order of St. Caroline; had decorated this
person with the insignia of that order, and had in other respects
acted in a manner unbecoming a British princess, which brought
upon her the continued displeasure of the king.&nbsp; He ordered
evidence to be taken against her, and it was determined she
should be brought to trial by the peers of the realm.&nbsp; This
trial, which lasted fifty-three days, being ended, violent
debates took place in the House of Lords on the principle of the
Bill, and the proposed measure of depriving the queen, of her
title, prerogatives, rights, and privileges, formally
abandoned.&nbsp; This was hailed as a complete acquittal by her
friends, and was celebrated as such by public rejoicings and
illuminations, reaching my parish.</p>
<p>But the King&rsquo;s anger was not appeased.&nbsp; The 19th
day of July, 1821, was the day fixed for the coronation
service.&nbsp; It was said to have been a magnificent ceremony,
surpassing anything that had ever occurred on former
occasions.&nbsp; But the queen, who had repeatedly applied to
have a place appointed for her to see the ceremony, on going to
the Abbey was refused admittance by the door-keepers, they not
daring to let anyone pass who had not a coronation ticket.&nbsp;
Thus mortified and humbled, she returned to her house, and the
impression it made on her mind was never eradicated.&nbsp;
Harassed by severe and bitter trials, she was seized with a
sudden illness, which baffled the skill of her physicians, and on
the 7th August she breathed her last, being in the fifty-fourth
year of her age, her body being conveyed to Brunswick, and
deposited in the vault of her ancestors.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, the narration of those circumstances would seem
to be a digression, yet they are to my mind full of interest, and
so closely interwoven <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>among my early associations that I
cannot easily pass over them.&nbsp; I well remember the
exhibition which took place in my native village.&nbsp; On one of
the large painted pictures was displayed a figure of the queen in
her robes, and beneath was the brilliant motto,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Regina&rdquo; still, in spite of them,<br
/>
Here then we rest.&nbsp; The universal cause<br />
Acts to one end, but acts by various laws;<br />
Let this great truth be present night and day,<br />
But most be present if we preach or pray.</p>

<p>There was nearly as much for me to do on a Sunday, during the
winter season, as on other days; the cattle must be fed; turnips
within, and straw without, must be placed ready for the cows to
eat, and the fat pigs were to be attended to, of which there was
a good number, but sometimes I had an opportunity of going to
chapel, on an afternoon, when my work was forward; and there were
reading services in the family on Sunday evenings, implying there
was a desire to serve and obey the true and living God.</p>
<p>Thus much for a beginning.&nbsp; I soon learned to drive the
tumbril, the harrow, the roller, and the wagon, and was, perhaps,
nearly as useful as was expected to be; and on one occasion the
master made me draw a furrow across a field with a pair of
horses, he following, and pronounced himself satisfied with the
result.</p>
<p>During my sojourn here, I was several times mercifully
preserved from death.&nbsp; On one occasion I was driving a
loaded tumbril from the yard, where it was filled, to the manure
heap, about a quarter-of-a mile on the road, and then on to the
meadow.&nbsp; A horse which I was using, a wild young creature,
annoyed by the flies, started off as soon as I got upon his
back.&nbsp; I was quite powerless, and lost all control over
him.&nbsp; He went at full gallop straight <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>home, and
though a cart shed, that was standing by the road-side, having
beams across, and so constructed that there was little height
more than was required for an empty wagon.&nbsp; I pressed my
head down as low as I could, and the interposing mercy of my God
preserved me, or I should have been dashed to pieces.&nbsp; The
horse ran quite through, and then stopped as if by magic.&nbsp;
The men came out of the yard, seeing the danger, and expected to
have seen me killed, or seriously injured; but neither myself nor
the horse suffered any harm.&nbsp; I did not think much about it
at the time, but I have many times looked back with a thankful
heart.&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt remember all the way the Lord thy
God hath led thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another instance of great danger I will relate.&nbsp; One
summer&rsquo;s morning, being ordered to fetch the cows from the
meadow, amongst them being a furious bull, I found on my arrival
that one of the cows had calved during the night, close to which
the dangerous male had taken up a position.&nbsp; I hastened home
with the rest, and told the master what I had seen.&nbsp; It was
considered that if I had attempted to drive him he might have
killed me.&nbsp; The master directed me to take the barrow, and
he would go with me to the meadow, and take with him a
hay-fork.&nbsp; We went and found them as I have stated, and no
sooner had I placed the barrow near the bull than the infuriated
creature at once drove at me, and knocked me down, but the master
beat him off, and I was thus preserved from further danger at
that time, and escaped unharmed.</p>
<p>At another time, later on, the same beast attacked me in the
cow-yard, drove me against the faggots, and had got me completely
in his power.&nbsp; My peril was witnessed by Josh Miles, who was
thrashing in a barn.&nbsp; He came with his flail&mdash;a very
formidable instrument&mdash;and the beast fled immediately, and
leaped over a high gate like a hunting horse, and then looked
about <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>him
for the next point of attack.&nbsp; These, then, are some of the
deliverances extended unto me by the great and unceasing favour
of my God, for the which I desire to be devoutly thankful.</p>
<p>I am unable to enumerate all the dangers from which I have
been providentially delivered.&nbsp; That same horse which ran
away with me kicked me afterwards in the side, but my hand caught
the blow, and thus warded off serious injury.&nbsp; I was
accustomed to have one-footed kicks from the cows, but found the
horse struck out with more effect.&nbsp; Another peril was: As
myself and one of my young masters (Suffolk) were scarifying a
pea-stubble field we had two horses at length, and took turns,
one to ride on the scarifier, and the other to drive the
horses.&nbsp; We were going on very cheerful and comfortable,
when, suddenly, something distasted the fore horse, and it came
round to where I was sitting, and was entangled among the
counters with the horse&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; In the fright and the
danger we had some little difficulty to extricate the poor horse,
but we did accomplish it.&nbsp; I escaped with a few slight
scratches on my hands and legs, and what was better the horse was
not much hurt, so that ultimately we were able to accomplish our
work, and to give an account of our mishap to the master, without
incurring much blame.&nbsp; Here, again, I feel good cause for
thankfulness that I was so mercifully preserved, so
that&mdash;</p>

are past,<br />

<p>I might here be permitted to state my master, Mr. Garrard, at
this time, occupied a small farm in the parish of Stradbroke,
distant about three miles, to which myself and others were often
sent, to do different kinds of work, such as putting in the corn
with <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the
drill, sometimes getting in a good lot of turnips, at other times
getting up the hay and the corn in harvest, when we had a wagon
to be conveyed through the pleasant journey.&nbsp; Adjoining our
farm was one occupied by Mr. William Davey, and he also kept a
lad a year or two older than myself.&nbsp; He felt himself
sometimes aggrieved, because he had so much to do in waiting upon
his young masters, so he thought he would cut the matter short,
and, being sorely irritated, he got up early one morning (oh!
most dreadful act) and set fire to the straw in the barn, which
burnt and consumed the whole premises, except the
dwelling-house&mdash;an alarming conflagration; I saw it
blazing.&nbsp; He was taken upon suspicion, tried, and found
guilty, and sentenced to be executed, which sentence was carried
into effect at Ipswich, on the 20th April, 1822.&nbsp; A terrible
example to all young men was the death of William Aldous, late of
Stradbroke.</p>
<p>Having passed through the various degrees of training incident
to a farming establishment, including the diversified labours of
the season of harvest, for my master boarded his men, and in some
instances lodged them as well; and the harvests were in those
days somewhat cheerful and happy seasons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Crowned
with the sickle and the wheaten sheaf,&rdquo; the ingathering was
equal to the demand of the coming winter, however severe and
rigid that season might be.</p>
<p>My master usually kept a man at his off-farm, but during my
last two years of service with him he placed me in that
position.&nbsp; The farm-house was occupied by Samuel Tovell and
John Pulham.&nbsp; I lodged with the former, and fetched my food
from master&rsquo;s house, being allowed to take a horse, of
which I had two under my care, as also several bullocks and
pigs.&nbsp; I used to go to master&rsquo;s house, and have Sunday
dinner, and one evening during the week regularly.</p>
<p>I received no money for my work, my remuneration <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>was board,
lodging, washing, and clothes.&nbsp; My master trusted to me to
obey his orders, spoke well of me, and I was encouraged by the
designation of steward.&nbsp; I was promised that, if I was
willing, I should be put to a business, which would be better
than being at a farm-house.&nbsp; As time rolled on, a
neighbouring farmer, a friend of my master (Mr. Lenny), removed
from out of the parish to Worlingham, and that gentleman was
requested to look out for something for me.&nbsp; He was
successful, and it was arranged that I should be placed under the
care of Mr. George Sutton, a shoemaker, of that parish.</p>
<p>My parents consented, and arrangements being completed, I was
told to prepare for my new destination.&nbsp; Accordingly, I bade
farewell to my old neighbours and friends at Stradbroke and
Laxfield, and in the month of May, 1825, I started with George
Pead, the carrier, to Halesworth, to meet my new master, and
thence to continue my journey to Worlingham, my future
residence.</p>
<p>The day was fine, the country looking cheerful after the
storms of winter, and our journey was accomplished in due course
safely.&nbsp; I had now time to look around and reflect on my
change.&nbsp; I did not feel very joyful at my new prospects; I
felt that I was a &ldquo;stranger in a strange land;&rdquo; I
thought of old associations, and that did not add to my
comfort.&nbsp; However, amidst many discouragements, I thought
that if I could learn my business, I could settle down in after
life, and be able to obtain employment, and support those who
might be in some measure dependent on me.</p>
<p>My master was held to be a good tradesman, and appeared to
have a good run of trade; but I soon found he indulged in habits
of drinking to excess.&nbsp; There was no veneration for the
Sabbath, and consequently no reverence for God&rsquo;s
commands.&nbsp; He also <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>indulged in profane conversation,
such as I had not hitherto been accustomed to; but I prayed for
him.</p>
<p>My mistress was a tender-hearted, godly, pious woman, and
would often speak kindly to me when master was harsh, so that my
sorrows were not greatly multiplied.&nbsp; Mr. Lenny came to see
me at my new place (I had known that gentleman when he resided at
Laxfield); he harassed my feelings; brought before my mind old
associations, from whom I was severed.&nbsp; I felt completely
broken down.&nbsp; I have no doubt that was the end he had in
view.&nbsp; He afterwards tendered a few healing words of
sympathy and kindness, and said that he would write to Laxfield,
and let my friends there know how I was getting on, and that, if
I continued with my master, and was obliging, he would give me a
Christmas-box.&nbsp; After hearing these and other promises, I
resigned myself to my new situation, and felt that I would do my
best, and try to learn to work.</p>
<p>After having been there a month, it was arranged that I should
be bound, Mr. L. being sponsor.&nbsp; An indenture was prepared,
and my own consent, and that of my parents, being obtained, I was
bound as an indoor apprentice, to learn the art and mystery of a
bootmaker, for the space of four years, thirty-one weeks, and
four days.</p>
<p>This seemed a long time to look forward, but I was beginning
to feel more reconciled.&nbsp; I visited the customers with the
master; had a good share of jobs to attend to, as well as
errands, the diversity of waiting upon the master, the mistress,
the children, the cow, the pony, and the pigs, and my odd hours
were to be spent in the work shop, in learning to stitch pieces
of leather together.</p>
<p>This latter was, to say the least of it, a tedious operation;
I suffered pain in my neck and back, but I had a fair amount of
relaxation, and during the <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>whole of that summer I was not bound
down very closely to the trade, and had become somewhat
acquainted with the young people of that locality, by which I was
cheered.</p>
<p>One of my acquaintances was a young man, apprenticed to
William Pidgeon, named John Scarlett.&nbsp; That young man was a
vessel of mercy, soon to be gathered home to the heavenly
garner.&nbsp; He was my guide, philosopher, and friend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the House of
God&rdquo; in company.&nbsp; He sought, and obtained, instruction
from the best source, and in turn I myself received much valuable
instruction from him.</p>
<p>The first Christmas arrived.&nbsp; During my apprenticeship I
was permitted to go to Laxfield, and see my parents.&nbsp; I had
not forgotten the promise as to the Christmas-box, so I called on
Mr. Lenny, and reminded him of what I had not forgotten at this
happy season.&nbsp; I was invited to sit down to table with his
people, and have a bowl of good firmity.&nbsp; While I was
enjoying the comfortable meal, Mr. L. came into the room, and
asked me if I thought I could ride a pony to Laxfield.&nbsp; I
was happy to answer in the affirmative.&nbsp; Orders were given,
the pony was brought out, and doubly glad was I to go and see my
parents, and also to be furnished with a horse to ride; but I was
to leave it with Mr. Alling, the gentleman who had been
successful in preserving my eyesight, as before stated.</p>
<p>I delivered up my charge, with a letter of instructions from
the sender.&nbsp; I knew that Mr. Lenny&rsquo;s eldest son was
living with Mr. Alling, and most likely the pony was for his
son&rsquo;s use.&nbsp; However, I had performed my engagement
safely.&nbsp; My short Christmas holiday soon came to an end,
and, taking leave of my parents, I was now, for the first time,
on foot, to measure the whole length of that dreary road that
intervened between the past and the future&mdash;the past <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>I was
somewhat acquainted with, but as to the future, I wondered and
pondered, and sped my way onward, sometimes with tardy steps and
a heavy heart, but during the evening of that short
winter&rsquo;s day I arrived home.</p>
<p>I was under a promise to write to my parents, and inform them
if I was once more safe at home.&nbsp; The postage was high at
that time, being eightpence for each letter.&nbsp; We had not as
yet felt the benefit of Rowland Hill&rsquo;s cheap postage,
although we had the benefit of &ldquo;Rowland Hill&rsquo;s
Village Dialogues&rdquo;&mdash;these are good and profitable.</p>
<p>I passed through my first winter pretty comfortable, now and
then being sent out with the pony, and sometimes with the cart,
which pleased me very well, as I so enjoyed a trip.</p>
<p>One morning I was called up rather early to fetch some milk
for the family, for the cow was not always in profit.&nbsp; As
soon as I had put on my boots, and had opened the door, I fell
down perfectly insensible and unconscious.&nbsp; My master and
mistress were on the room above.&nbsp; They thought I was gone
out, but when they found I was not, they soon came to see.&nbsp;
They were greatly alarmed thinking it might occur frequently; and
I thought how easily my Father and my God could have removed me
from this troublesome world.&nbsp; But thanks to His great
goodness and mercy, I never remember to have had a recurrence of
that solemn visitation.&nbsp; It brought me to consider my state
by nature, as a sinner before God; and I expressed gratitude and
thankfulness that my life was still preserved.</p>
<p>Thenceforth, I resolved to seek the Lord, feeling that it was
my bounden duty to serve Him, and I prayed for direction in this
important matter.&nbsp; My young friend, Scarlett, of whom I have
spoken, was permitted to attend the Wesleyan Chapel, at North <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Cove, and
myself was also allowed to join him, and we felt it a privilege
to listen to the truths as there taught.&nbsp; We felt that the
Most High was the Father of Mercies, imparted to us, his
creatures, through the atonement of Christ for the remission of
sins.&nbsp; My friend&rsquo;s views were Calvanistic; mine were
not so, and we were prompted and exhorted to search the
Scriptures.&nbsp; We did search, comparing spiritual things with
spiritual help from above.</p>
<p>About this time, one of the members of the chapel (Mrs. Keer),
of Mutford, was removed by death, and a funeral sermon was
preached in North Cove Chapel, from the words: &ldquo;Let me die
the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like
his.&rdquo;&nbsp; We had then placed before us the
characteristics of a christian, or a believer, seeking salvation
through the merits of the Great Redeemer, and as obedient
children looking and praying and watching to the end of our
course, amidst the temptations and impediments that bestrew our
pathway here below.&nbsp; These timely observations and other
christian duties were insisted on by Mr. Gibson, the good
minister, the burden of which we treasured up in our young minds,
and in the case of my friend I have no doubt produced good fruit
unto eternal life, for his was destined to be but a short journey
to the Celestial City.</p>
<p>Mr. Pidgeon kept a cow, as did my master, and we sometimes had
to drive them to marsh in the summer season&mdash;about a
mile.&nbsp; We almost always had to go on Sundays, and then we
could talk over our religious impressions and other
matters.&nbsp; As he had a pious mother, who prayed for him,
consequently he was a beloved partaker of the benefit, and he did
appreciate it as a brother beloved, elected of God.</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis well with the righteous, God views them
as such,<br />
They go to their Father, and can&rsquo;t ask too much;<br />
In Christ, they are righteous, and who dare bring a charge?<br />
The blood of atonement hath signed their discharge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>One
Sunday morning, having gone down with our masters&rsquo; cows,
and placed them at their food, we had a little leisure to think,
and to talk over the goodness of God to us, his creatures.&nbsp;
Coming to an alder tree, fresh and green, my companion stopped,
and&mdash;taking off his cap said: &ldquo;Here we must have a
little bit of prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those were the words.&nbsp; I
was taken somewhat by surprise.&nbsp; We both knelt&mdash;the
grass was our carpet; John led off in earnest, solemn, heartfelt
prayer, possessing the true spirit of devotion&mdash;heard, and
witnessed, and accepted in the heavenly courts above, indicating
an earnest of the promised possession of the heavenly
inheritance.&nbsp; I feel something of the rekindling of
God&rsquo;s love while I am recording this interesting
incident.&nbsp; When he had concluded I felt also prompted to
make the attempt, in compliance with his request, but my
sentences were feeble and broken, the very first that were ever
heard in prayer by a fellow-creature.</p>
<p>We often resorted thither for prayer subsequently, and often
felt it to be a time of refreshing from the presence of the
Lord.&nbsp; Once, on a Beccles horse-racing occasion, we repaired
thither, and prayed for the giddy multitude, as also for our
friends and acquaintances.&nbsp; There was another young man,
James Taylor, whom we wished to draw into our company; but, he
being a servant, soon changed his master, and went beyond our
reach.&nbsp; He is also gone to rest, having died at Lowestoft
about 1860.</p>
<p>I attended to the commands of my master and mistress; was
fairly fed; and my duties were not very stringent.&nbsp; I was
not bound down so closely on the shop seat, but had plenty of
outing, and oftentimes worked very late at night, so that we
might forward our work, and accomplish the orders by the end of
the week, although there was often too much to be done on a
Sunday.&nbsp; My master oft indulged himself in such company as
are to be found in public-houses, <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>even on the Sabbath.&nbsp; There were
in those days no restrictions as to the hours.&nbsp; The houses
were kept open all day long, and sometimes he would take me with
him, if there was not anything to take me in any other
direction.&nbsp; On one occasion he stayed at the
&ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; at Beccles, a long time, and being unwilling
to part with the company he sent me on to Gillingham, two miles
further.&nbsp; He had a customer who lived through Gillingham
Toll-gale; thither I was to go to transact business, and then
return.&nbsp; On my return, he was not ready to go home with me,
but said he would be soon.&nbsp; After waiting till I was tired,
I set off to go home to Worlingham.&nbsp; The mistress, knowing I
had gone out with the master, insisted upon knowing where I had
left him; I stated the truth.&nbsp; She felt uncomfortable, and
said she would go and fetch him home.&nbsp; I said that it would
not be advisable; that there were drunken people, who would laugh
to see her sorrows multiplied; and that, perhaps, she would bear
words by which she would be more grieved.&nbsp; She did not go,
and for years after she appreciated the advice it was my
happiness to tender on that occasion.</p>
<p>I made progress in my trade; the time&mdash;4 years, 31 weeks,
and 4 days were being reduced, for time flies.&nbsp; My
master&rsquo;s father occupied a small farm in the same
parish.&nbsp; Master and I used often to go and help him in busy
seasons, such as hay and harvest seasons.&nbsp; I was also
allowed to help master&rsquo;s customers a few days during the
harvest, being always supplied with good harvest food; sometimes
the strong ale would make me stagger; and, although I had to work
harder, somehow I always felt delighted with the change.</p>
<p>We had only one service at the parish church each Sunday, that
being one reason why I was permitted to <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>attend
chapel, and sometimes my friend John and I were allowed to go to
the Primitive Chapel, at Beccles.&nbsp; This was during the early
ministry of Robert Key; and sometimes we were privileged to
listen to that good man, and were instructed and comforted
thereby, admiring his plain and easy style of preaching, the
gospel of truth and love, through the atonement and satisfaction
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the infinite importance of being
saved from wrath through Him.&nbsp; The good Lord crowned this
man&rsquo;s efforts with abundant success, and he became a
&ldquo;burning and a shining light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My master was a kind of sportsman; he kept a gun, also a dog,
and occasionally used them.&nbsp; We were friendly with the
gamekeeper, and as we did not annoy or pursue the game, no notice
was taken of the master.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; for I was
allowed to use the gun, and shoot as many wood-pigeons as I could
during the winter seasons, for we could not work much at the
trade during the sharp weather.&nbsp; The family
increased&mdash;a third son was born named Robert; in process of
time a fourth named Samuel.&nbsp; Master built a workshop, for
the cottage was becoming too small.&nbsp; He suggested that I
should lodge in the new building.&nbsp; I preferred staying in
the old quarters, and ultimately was permitted to do so to the
end of my engagement.</p>
<p>I had often to go very long journeys on Sunday
mornings&mdash;especially those Sundays when there was no service
at church&mdash;to Ellough, to Hulver, to Henstead, to Mutford,
and sometimes through Beccles to Gillingham, and on one occasion
I went with master to Bungay on business.&nbsp; In this and many
other ways the Sabbath was greatly desecrated, while the world
with its fascinations and alurements obtained faithful
service.</p>
<p>About this time a very tragical affair occurred in <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>our
parish.&nbsp; My friend&rsquo;s master was on his way home from
Beccles, one Saturday night, very late, when, before he arrived
at his house, he was attacked by a ruffian, beaten about the
head, and almost killed.&nbsp; It was said he would have been
quite murdered, but he had a very thick hairy
head&mdash;something like a negro&rsquo;s&mdash;by reason thereof
the blows did not take fatal effect.</p>
<p>He managed to reach home, and they naturally were greatly
alarmed at his condition.&nbsp; My friend was called up, and sent
to Beccles for the doctor.&nbsp; He had to go past where the
murderous attack had been committed, the ground being still moist
with blood.&nbsp; Coming to the place, he told me, he came upon
his master&rsquo;s hat, and having placed it over into Worlingham
Park till his return, went forward again unmolested.&nbsp;
Arriving at the town, by Fair Close, when near the Prison, there
was a gate and a style, he said he knelt down, and prayed that
the Lord would be merciful to his master, and heal him, and spare
him a little longer.&nbsp; This was, perhaps, the first prayer
offered in Beccles on that Sunday morning&mdash;it was past
midnight.&nbsp; When his poor injured master arrived at his home
that prayer was heard and answered, for by assiduous and skilful
treatment, poor William Pidgeon&rsquo;s life was preserved some
twenty years longer.&nbsp; A reward &pound;100 was offered by the
Government, upon proof of the offence being established against
the perpetrator, but it was not discovered until the poor
conscience stricken miserable wretch confessed to it upon his
dying bed.&nbsp; This was the outcome of the burden of a guilty
conscience.</p>
<p>During all my servitude hitherto I had but a small amount of
pocket money; but in my last year, 1829, after earning a certain
sum for master weekly, I was allowed the surplus, and, another
coming in to take <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>some of the out-door turns, I could sit and work at the
trade more closely, and with more energy, and this also proved an
advantage to the master, as well as to myself: thus our interests
were to a certain extent mutual, although when a mistake
happened, as it sometimes did, then it would assuredly be
religion that was most ridiculed, of the which poor master could
not discover there was any necessity, although admonished by
repeated warnings that our days are as a vapour which soon
vanisheth away.</p>
<p>I was now becoming more and more acquainted with the trade of
country boot-making, and was considered, as an apprentice, a very
decent hand, considering I was learning in a village.&nbsp; I
liked my trade tolerably well, and was, perhaps, on the whole,
fairly obliging, amongst the wax, the thread, the leather, and
the nails, and all other concomitants incident to a boot-making
establishment, to which I had, by this time, become almost
naturalised, and felt quite at home as a few extra pence came
into my pocket, for although I had permission to go to Beccles to
fairs and races, and such like amusements, yet I did not often
prefer to accept those seeming favours&mdash;those gilded
baubles, which perish with the using.&nbsp; My friend would say,
&ldquo;Let us go for our cows an hour sooner, then we can kneel
down and pray for the giddy, noisy multitude,&rdquo; many of whom
were slaves to sin and Satan, fast bound in the snare, from which
nothing short of a divine power can extricate&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>So sad our state by nature is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sin how deep its stains,<br />
And Satan binds our willing souls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast in his slavish chains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One very warm summer day, we (that is, myself, master, and his
father) were after the hay, on the bank of the Waveney, and I
told them I should like to have <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>a bathe.&nbsp; They cautioned me to
be careful I was not drowned.&nbsp; I repeated that I should make
the attempt, but they tried to dissuade me.&nbsp; I told them to
&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; and I went over and back easily and
safety&mdash;preserved and supported by an Omnipotent Almighty
hand, when many have been permitted to sink in the stream, and
are lost! lost! lost! for ever.&nbsp; This is the manner in which
my giddy steps were preserved, and my youthful career safely and
lovingly onward led, and I was permitted to see the &ldquo;bright
light in the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will now state that my apprenticeship closed on the 31st of
December, in the year above-mentioned.&nbsp; It began on the 24th
of May, 1825.&nbsp; Having agreed with my master to work for him
for a time, I commenced to work as journeyman.&nbsp; After having
visited a few of my old friends, I took lodgings near with a
couple of aged people named Whyatt, where I was very
comfortable.&nbsp; Their youngest son had been apprenticed to Mr.
Pidgeon, my friend John having left, or was about leaving his
master, and very soon after was summoned to bid adieu to all
earthly things, and to enter into his everlasting rest, into
which the writer desires to be found, waiting and watching, even
unto the end of his course.</p>
<p>I started in housekeeping&mdash;bought good bread at
Jones&rsquo;s, of Beccles, and good meat at Crickmoy&rsquo;s,
near the &ldquo;Red Lion Inn,&rdquo; and other necessaries were
easily obtainable, so that I got on during the first winter
fairly well, but had not much money to spare, for perhaps I could
have done more work if I had had more alloted to me, but was
thankful that the prospect was encouraging.&nbsp; I worked and
sung, walked to my lodgings and enjoyed my coffee and my
rest.&nbsp; I did not book myself at this station only for a
short time; the other apprentice, James Smith, was <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>becoming
useful, and as the winter passed away, the work in summer did not
come in so briskly.</p>
<p>During the summer of this year, 1830, the reign of George IV.
came to an end, a short reign, but many troubles, and the
national mind manifested no expression of regret on the demise of
this self-indulgent and passion-gratifying monarch, while that of
his predecessor was said to be just, pious, temperate, and
beneficent; every domestic and social grace adorned his
character&mdash;the ruler and the ornament of a powerful and
wealthy empire.</p>
<p>William Henry succeeded to the throne under the title of
William IV.</p>
<p>As it happened, the people at Worlingham, with whom I lodged
had a son, who had just taken a business in the parish of St.
Lawrence, near Bungay, an agricultural district.&nbsp; This man,
wanting another hand, I was engaged to go there to work for him,
for a time: but the poor master was not very successful.&nbsp;
His wife was afflicted with violent epileptic fits.&nbsp; I
continued with him about a year, and we had a good run of work,
but adverse circumstances bore him down, and in a short time
after he left his suffering wife in the care of her parents, sold
his effects, and emigrated to America, and I heard but little
more of George Whyatt.&nbsp; As to myself, I was glad to leave
the neighbourhood, for gross darkness seemed to have covered the
minds of the people, being &ldquo;led captive by the adversary at
his will,&rdquo; from whose power they were not easily delivered,
except by divine interposition.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Royal Oak&rdquo;
was the place of meeting on Sundays.&nbsp; There were then no
prohibited hours.&nbsp; Those, who appeared to be of the better
class, did not scruple to spend the best part of the Sabbath at
the tavern&mdash;sad waste of life and time.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>From
this place, I thought I should like to obtain work at Laxfield,
my native village.&nbsp; My parents were still there, and I
tried, but did not succeed.&nbsp; There was no open door, and the
right way was more eastward and I once more tented my steps to
Worlingham, and perhaps felt more happy than I had been for some
time.&nbsp; Being accepted at my former lodgings, I worked
sometimes for my late master, and sometimes for his father, and
had the free use of my hands and feet, and withal felt the
privilege of breathing in a more salubrious atmosphere, the
comfort of which I felt to be of considerable value, as my aim
was not to be conformed to the world.&nbsp; I could attend the
services of the church, and also the services of the Wesleyan
Methodist Chapel, where I found much spiritual instruction,
although, by the way, I did not endorse all their
sentiments.&nbsp; My views were becoming Calvanistic, which were
strengthened when I occasionally heard Mr. George Wright, Baptist
Minister, of Beccles, and Mr. Sloper, of the Congregational
Chapel of that town, both of whom are departed hence, and have
entered into their rest to be for ever with the Lord, while it is
my privilege to follow, although at an humble distance, amid the
perplexing and diversified vicissitudes to which poor fallen man
is subject in this time state, and having no settled and
permanent repose, is continually reminded that the true and
substantial rest is at the end of his journey, if sought after
according to the instructions contained in God&rsquo;s Holy
Word.</p>
<p>About this time I thought as I had no one but myself, I would
try gentleman&rsquo;s service, not that I had any particular wish
to leave Worlingham, but on the whole I thought I might better my
condition, so agreed to go into the service of Edmund Skepper,
Esq., Maltster, at Oulton, in the capacity of a groom and
gardener.&nbsp; The family here consisted of master, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>mistress,
widowed daughter, and grand daughter, two female servants,
myself, and a lad living out to attend to cows, fowls, pigs,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The family professed to serve the Lord, the house-hold were
summoned to morning devotion before breakfast: a short piece
being read and prayer offered; also evenings before retiring to
rest, bible reading and prayer: sermon and prayer on Sunday
evenings.</p>
<p>The services at the parish church were held alternately
morning and afternoon, the other part we generally attended the
church at Lowestoft, where we heard good Mr. Cunningham, or his
curate, Mr. Hankinson, or Mr. Hawtry, of Pakefield; there was
also a religious service held at a cottage near, conducted by Mr.
Skepper, jun., who resided near with his family.&nbsp; At times I
was permitted to attend those evening services, but that
gentleman was not permitted to stay here but 42 years, he was
attacked with violent typus fever during the summer of 1837, and
was carried off after a short illness, leaving a widow with four
sons and two daughters to mourn their loss.&nbsp; I wrote a few
verses on the occasion of his funeral, this is a specimen.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh messenger, how keen thy blow,<br />
Our worthy friend thou hast laid low:<br />
Yet we rejoice our reason&rsquo;s just,<br />
In Jesus&rsquo; blood he placed his trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not reside with this gentleman&rsquo;s father at the
time of his death, he having died the previous year, 1836, the
mother having died in 1835.&nbsp; How quickly we are gone!</p>
<p>I must beg to make a retrograde movement here, and go back to
the duties devolving on me as gardener: the winter rolled on and
spring approached, preparations were needed, there was in the
garden a forcing pit, such an one I had never before seen, I
sought and obtained the advice and assistance of Richard <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Sturman, he
directed me how to proceed; acting under his advice we had a
satisfactory supply of cucumbers, melons, and other garden
produce.</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Skepper greatly admired the colony of rooks that
assembled during the early spring, and when their young ones were
about leaving, he used to being out his air gun and bring down
the black family with great precision, my duty on those occasions
was to perform the office of armour bearer, and to pump the air
into the empty tube while the other was being expended; it was
rather a hard job but did not last many hours at a time, and then
only in fine weather.&nbsp; I had also to grind and deliver out
small quantities of malt (not less then a peck), to the
workpeople and others, the grinding was performed by a handmill,
but when any extra quantity was required, I had the assistance of
the lad John Adams, who was always at hand, and willing to lend a
helping hand in any emergency, although often irritated by there
petition of the noisy bell, which generally stood very handy to
summon the out-of-door satellites.</p>
<p>I usually drove master out two or three times a week,
sometimes to Lowestoft, or Beccles, or Yarmouth, or other places,
calling upon farmers and others in the way of trade.&nbsp; God,
in his goodness, so preserved us that we never met with any
accident, although late at night getting home.&nbsp; Their
daughter, Mrs. Clarke, had a pony and chaise for the private use
of herself and daughter.&nbsp; I did not drive them except on
Sunday to Church, to Lowestoft or Pakefield, as they felt
inclined.</p>
<p>In the month of July of the first year I was living with this
family, I lost my dear father by death, he being only 59 years
off age&mdash;1833.&nbsp; My mother was left to sorrow for his
departure, and to work her way through the various trials which
bestrewed her path, supported by a watchful, kind, overruling
Providence, many years.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Favoured with an excellent state of health, I did not at
all regret leaving the shoe trade for a time, and perhaps this
healthful employment may have been the means of lengthening out
my life, under the divine favour who has guarded my steps in all
my journey hitherto, and will continue to do so unto the end of
my course.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Fisher was rector of Oulton at this time, having
been appointed in 1829.&nbsp; He was greatly afflicted, and had a
curate, Mr. Richard Pearson, to perform the duties in the
parish.&nbsp; I forbear to insert the prefix which clergymen of
the Church of England, and many Dissenting ministers also use,
because I think the appellation belongs to God rather than to His
creatures, however pure and holy their office or character.&nbsp;
Whenever I hear it spoken as applied to a creature, it grates
harshly on my ear, but it may be consistent nevertheless.</p>
<p>I had often an opportunity of conversing with John Adams, the
elder (a working maltster on the establishment), and his good
wife, both members of a Christian church, who were seeking to
walk in the ways of the Lord.&nbsp; I also felt a longing desire
to follow in their steps, as they were following Christ, our
Great Redeemer, the infinite freeness, and the unspeakable
preciousness of his electing love.&nbsp; Why were any chosen,
when all might justly have been passed by?&nbsp; Because he was
resolved, for His own name&rsquo;s sake, to make known the riches
of His glory on the vessels of mercy, whom He therefore prepared
unto grace and glory.</p>
<p>Thus, then, the summer of 1833 passed away.&nbsp; The garden
crops had been very fair, and the orchard crops were
abundant.&nbsp; I revelled among the apples, plums, pears and
walnuts, day after day, when the weather was suitable.&nbsp; In
process of time, they were stored, as a supply for the family
during the approaching winter, and, moreover, I engaged to remain
with the family another year.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>The
storage of potatoes now commenced.&nbsp; A large space had been
planted, and now they must be gathered in.&nbsp; Happily, there
were no traces of that fearful blight, which have been so
prevalent in these latter years, and which we trust will speedily
be removed by the interposition of a kind and merciful God, who
assuredly doeth all things well, as the preservation of our lives
and health abundantly testify, rejoicing our hearts as we are
permitted to gather in the superabundant blessings bestowed by
the Fatherly hand of the Giver of all good.</p>
<p>The spring succeeded; the ground required preparation, and for
crops to be got in no time must now be lost, and, with the
assistance of a man now and again, to do some of the heavy
digging, and by perseverance, favoured with a continuation of
health, and other blessings, I felt that the onward course was
somewhat cheerful, rejoicing in the notes of the peacock, the
cuckoo, the nightingale, and others of the feathered throng by
which we were surrounded.</p>
<p>It was in this place that I first saw my future wife.&nbsp;
She had come into the same service as housemaid, and Mary Ann
Newson (the future wife of George Anguish) as cook and
dairymaid.&nbsp; Very industrious servants they were, considering
Oulton Hall was not the best constructed residence.&nbsp; There
was a flight of stairs from the kitchen, but they led to the
mistress and master&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; I was only permitted to
pass through that room by special license, at other times having
to pass through the parlour on my way to a corridor which led to
my bedroom: the family had not then retired to rest.&nbsp; We had
reading and prayers at half past eight o&rsquo;clock, then I had
to go out and see if all was right, and pass quietly to bed at
nine.&nbsp; There was always plenty of work requiring to be
done&mdash;horses and chaises to be attended to, going out when
ordered, gravel and grass in front to keep in order, crops in <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>garden to
keep up in succession, weeds to keep down, walks to keep neat,
fruit to protect from a hundred and one enemies, against some of
which I had to wage war, and make their destruction sure, no
longer to cause any annoyance.</p>
<p>The season of summer quickly passed away, and the 11th of
October, 1834, arrived, when my agreement expired, as also did
the female servants&rsquo;, and new situations were now
sought.&nbsp; For myself, I thought I would turn my attention to
the boot line, at Lowestoft, but soon found my work would not
pass, as being not altogether suitable for town inspection,
consequently, I agreed with Mr. R. Winyard, a practical
bootmaker, of the High-street, to club myself to him for one
year, he to find me all the work I could fairly do, and himself
to instruct me in the art, where he saw my knowledge
defective.&nbsp; My future wife (Hannah Cox) obtained a situation
as housemaid in the family of E. Norton, Esq., solicitor, London
Road.</p>
<p>There had been two young men, just before, in the service of
Mr. Winyard, who had sickened and died.&nbsp; This was rather a
singular, as also a discouraging circumstance, yet I thought if
the good Lord was pleased to continue unto me good health, I
would try to do my best, so that I should be able in future to
obtain employment.&nbsp; I soon found my work had to pass through
a different process to what I had been accustomed.&nbsp; The
master was patient, and set before me what he considered correct
lines, in preference to those which I had acquired in the
country, for although he had served his apprenticeship in the
country at the time I was serving, but not with the same master,
yet, after his time expired, he worked in large manufacturing
towns, such as Norwich, Northampton, Cambridge, and Bedford, from
which latter place he brought his wife, and settled down in <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Lowestoft,
and obtained a good fair share of the work of that town.</p>
<p>As to myself, my means were rather limited.&nbsp; I found I
must adhere to economy.&nbsp; I lodged in the master&rsquo;s
house, so that when business was urgent, I could rise early and
attend to it, and had not to wait for anyone to let me in.&nbsp;
This was rather an advantage, which was duly appreciated, whether
in winter or summer.&nbsp; Our principal work was Wellington
boots and Bluchers.&nbsp; I came in for a good share of this
work, as there was also a man from Norwich, who done the
women&rsquo;s work, and there was likewise a good share of
blocking done by me.&nbsp; That was a process I had not witnessed
during my apprenticeship.&nbsp; It was to strain the fronts of
Wellingtons and other boots, so that they might fit and set close
upon the instep, clean and even, that the boot might be
comfortable and smart when it was worn.</p>
<p>There was another bootmaker on the opposite side of the
street, and there he exhibited a show boot.&nbsp; The fingers of
our Norwich man seemed eager to tear this unnecessary appendage
from its not very lofty position.&nbsp; It was decided that down
it must come.&nbsp; There were no policemen in Lowestoft at this
time, otherwise our steps would have been more marked with
prudence.&nbsp; A ladder was marked out at a building, and about
midnight Mr. Palmer&rsquo;s elegant boot went speedily down the
turnpike, its mutilated remains being subsequently found in a
garden in that direction, never more to be restored to its former
position, however much it might be needed.</p>
<p>This was to me an obscure and hazy atmosphere; the family did
not reverence the Lord; there was not that veneration for the
Sabbath, to which I had been accustomed, the motto most absorbing
was working, eating, and drinking, but I had an upper room to
myself and when the day&rsquo;s business was over, I enjoyed that
retirement so desirable and refreshing to all <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>God&rsquo;s
children.&nbsp; I preserved in the business, under the
instruction of the master.</p>
<p>There were two apprentices on the shop, George Nobbs and
George Youngman.&nbsp; There was also a journeyman of the name of
Edward Marjoram, all of them having died young men, while I am
suffered to journey onward, amidst many difficulties, yet still
supplied, protected, and sustained by the good hand of my
God.</p>
<p>Amidst the many changes, the cares, the dangers, and the
perplexities, as also the many comforts, I experienced, the year
rolled away, and my experience gave me reasons to hope that I
should have a fair amount of work in the establishment, with fair
wages, which, to a certain extent, was realised, so that onward I
continued to work for Mr. Winyard, at Lowestoft.</p>
<p>My sweetheart having left Mr. Norton&rsquo;s family, she
subsequently obtained a situation at Yarmouth, in the family of
J. Hurry, Esq., as she said she thought it best to take a wider
distance.&nbsp; I continued to work at Lowestoft, as before, and
was elevated to the master&rsquo;s seat, there being nearly
enough for him to attend to downstairs, and at other
places.&nbsp; I felt desirous of making the best use of my time,
and being on piecework, could sometimes make long days, but at
other times work did not come up so freely.&nbsp; Then the hands
became impatient and wearied, when anxious to earn money, and
could not seem to get forward.&nbsp; These were some of the
beginnings of the trials of life, and they were to be continued,
however desirous it might be to have them removed, but while
permitted, they have their effects upon those whom they are
designed to benefit.</p>
<p>The cheap postage had not yet come into operation, but letters
could be enclosed in brown paper, and thus, taking the form of a
parcel, were conveyed to <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Yarmouth, and safely delivered for
the sum of twopence, by Mr. John Balls, at that time a carrier,
residing at the corner of Duke&rsquo;s Head Street,
Lowestoft.</p>
<p>I continued to work in that town until drawing towards the
close of the summer of 1836.&nbsp; I was asked by Mrs. Clarke if
I would agree to come into her service; she would give me a week
to think it over.&nbsp; I did so, and knowing them to be quiet,
religious people, arranged to go to reside in their house, and be
their servant.&nbsp; They kept a pair of ponies and a
four-wheeled ph&aelig;ton.&nbsp; The family consisted of mistress
(a widow lady), daughter, housekeeper, and myself, so that when
all went out together, the carriage was fairly filled.</p>
<p>There had been several changes taken place since I left the
family at Oulton Hall in 1835, the mistress having died, and in
the following year the master was borne away, consequently the
brother, B. Skepper, Esq., before mentioned, agreed with Mrs.
Clarke, his sister, to change residences, the brother having
previously, with his family occupied the smaller house, the
&ldquo;Cottage.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was at the cottage, by the river
side where I was to be located during the approaching winter, and
soon became initiated in my new duties.&nbsp; The two ponies were
old acquaintances, as also the superiors, but I had to make the
acquaintance of the housekeeper and a furious-looking dog.&nbsp;
This was soon accomplished, and we professed to be a family
desirous of serving the Lord, the God of our fathers.&nbsp; There
was another cottage near, occupied by John Adams, his wife, and
family.&nbsp; They were people who for many years had been
walking in the ways of the Lord, and they felt anxious that my
hand should strengthened in this important matter.&nbsp; They
belonged to the denomination called Baptists, exhibiting and
illustrating the doctrine of our inability to do works meet for
repentance by reason of Adam&rsquo;s transgression, <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>we must first
have a good will, which is the gift of God, and then must have
divine grace working in us when we have that goodwill.&nbsp; And
these good works of ours, yea! our very best performances, are
taken to go for nothing in the matter of our salvation.&nbsp;
This must be accomplished entirety by the imputed righteousness
of our Saviour Jesus Christ.&nbsp; That our inability to repent
and believe it by reason of that spiritual death in which we are
by nature so fearfully involved.</p>
<p>My superiors were members of the Church of England, and the
housekeeper, although having lived in a clergyman&rsquo;s family,
yet she had been led to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
also to receive the ordinance of baptism by immersion, as the
only scriptural mode on a profession of faith in God&rsquo;s
beloved eternal Son.&nbsp; Here, again, we compared these
sentiments with God&rsquo;s word, searched the Scriptures daily,
whether things were so; many of these truths, which before had
been obscured by blindness and prejudice were now like beacons
shining brightly in a dark place.&nbsp; We, one and all, under
the teaching, the comforting, the illuminating, and instructing
power and guidance of the Holy Spirit went on our way
rejoicing.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Fisher, rector of the parish, having died in the
early part of this year, a new rector Edwin Proctor Dennis, came
to reside in Oulton, but as there was no rectory house suitable,
a new house was, after a little time built, and it was also
arranged there should be two services at the church instead of
one, as formerly.&nbsp; We usually attended those services at
least three of the four, one staying at home for a little
protection to the house, and on Sabbath evenings we drove off to
Lowestoft&mdash;superiors to St. Peter&rsquo;s, while the
servants were allowed to go to the Baptist Chapel, and to be down
with the carriage in time service was over.&nbsp; This was the
general routine: <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>occasionally we posted off to St. Peter&rsquo;s, on a
Sunday morning, but not often.</p>
<p>We were generally very quiet and unmolested.&nbsp; Now and
then, the mistress was somewhat annoyed by hearing the report of
a gun, and used to send me to look after the intruder, and, if
possible, obtain his name and authority, and bring in his
statement, but they were not proceeded against, only warned to
keep off the estate.&nbsp; I had here to attend to the garden,
and walks, as also carriage road through the meadow; carriage and
harness to keep in order; and many jobs indoors, so that, with
going out, my time was pretty well occupied.&nbsp; We had evening
and morning reading and prayers, and, on the whole, I had not
much to complain of.&nbsp; There was great regularity; each
evening and morning brought its work, and attention to be given
at the proper time.&nbsp; Winter being over, and the smiling
spring having arrived, the pleasant month of May, a relative of
the mistress had arranged to be married.&nbsp; My ladies were
invited to the wedding, and I was asked if the ponies could do
the journey&mdash;52 miles.&nbsp; I thought it could he
accomplished in two days, by stopping at Norwich (a distance of
24 miles) the first night, and by terminating the journey on the
second day.&nbsp; It will be remembered that, in the days to
which I am alluding, there were no railroads in these
parts.&nbsp; Next came the necessary preparations&mdash;it was
essential that the ponies should be in good health, their shoes
must be strong and good, harness must not be defective, and the
carriage in trim, and everything placed in readiness for the long
journey.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, we took our departure, the weather
being fine and the country charming; and, there being no
necessity for fast travelling, we were enabled to admire the
beauties of Nature, and to scan the various operations which were
being carried <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>on in the fields and roads as we passed.&nbsp; Norwich,
in due time, was reached.&nbsp; My mistress and her daughter were
driven to the residence of their friends, and I received
instructions to proceed with the vehicle to a livery stable,
situate in St. Giles&rsquo;, where the ponies were fed and
rested, I afterwards proceeding to my lodgings.&nbsp; The next
morning we were all astir, and, after having partaken of
breakfast, we again proceeded onwards.&nbsp; Mr. Pilgrim,
coroner&mdash;whose duties might have led him
thither&mdash;accompanied us to Dereham, and for the purpose of
placing him down, and also for feeding the ponies, we pulled up
at the Eagle Hotel.&nbsp; Resuming our journey, the great coach
passed us as we were nearing our destination, and the Manor
House, at Swaffham, was soon reached.</p>
<p>The nuptials were celebrated, Mr. William Clarke and his bride
left for their honeymoon.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that I have
ever seen them since.&nbsp; During our visit, of a week&rsquo;s
duration, in the day time I was at the Manor House, but at night
I slept at the house of the farm bailiff, at the neat little
lodge.</p>
<p>Swaffham church is possessed of a very handsome tower, the
bells of which rang out beautifully on that happy occasion.&nbsp;
It was a joyful season&mdash;the whole town seemed as if they
must be real joy birds, as the bridegroom was the only child of
his aged parents.</p>
<p>I attended church on the Sabbath morning, there being a large
congregation assembled within its walls; and in the afternoon
visited the Baptist Chapel with Alice (one of the servants at the
Manor House) and heard a very solemn discourse, delivered by Mr.
Hewitt, the minister at that place.&nbsp; The Union House was
then being built, and I have not seen it since it was
completed.&nbsp; We drove round several villages&mdash;Sporle,
Castleacre, and Southacre.&nbsp; Thus the time passed on, until
the period arrived for us to make our <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>return journey.&nbsp; In doing so, we
again stayed a night in Norwich, and subsequently, thanks for the
mercies of our God, we arrived safe at Oulton.</p>
<p>During the same year, 1837, Mrs. Clarke&rsquo;s only brother
was borne to a cold grave, being only 42 years of age.&nbsp; He
had just been altering the house and premises to his own mind,
when he was called away from this transitory state.&nbsp; My
youngest brother also sickened and died in this year, at the age
of 22, having been born in the month in which the battle of
Waterloo was fought.&nbsp; Seeing our days are as a vapour, every
sorrow cuts a string and urges us to rise.&nbsp; Thus we are
called to experience the various scenes of light and shade
through which we have to pass in prosecuting our journey to our
final home.</p>
<p>Having had many opportunities of discussing the subject of
regeneration and the new birth, and as God, in His boundless
mercy, had granted unto me the presence of His Holy Spirit to
witness with my spirit that He was indeed in earnest with me, and
thus I was brought to feel the weight of this question,
&ldquo;and now, why tarryist Thou, arise and be
baptised.&rdquo;&nbsp; I stated my convictions unto the church
worshipping at Lowestoft, opposite the Vicarage (now a school,)
and was baptised in June of that year by William Garwood,
&ldquo;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost,&rdquo; as an answer of an obedient and quickened
conscience towards my Lord and my God.&nbsp; I did not very much
enjoy the preaching of Mr. Denniss, our rector.&nbsp; He was
rather a domineering steward, contending that the Church of
England, the church of his fathers, was the only true church;
that it honours the bible, and was one of the oldest branches of
Christ&rsquo;s Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, while
dissenters and their creeds and ordinance, were erroneous and
misleading and would in the end prove destructive to body and
soul.&nbsp; I came into <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>collision with that gentlemen more
than once, for in those days I read the bible in search of truth,
and sometimes I felt I had aid and enlightenment given me from on
high, and I concluded that there were those apart from the Church
enjoying unspeakable happiness.</p>
<p>This eventful year rolled on with its multitude of joys and
sorrows, hastening us on through all life&rsquo;s varied stages,
continually seeking after happiness, our being&rsquo;s end and
aim, and labouring, working with our hands, the most important
method of obtaining the bread which sustains the body, as well as
being directed to that which endureth unto eternal life, which
shall be inherited and enjoyed by everyone of God&rsquo;s dear
children.&nbsp; I used to think that the entire little band who
resided at that remote corner of the vine-yard, at least all who
were come to years of maturity, were amongst that happy number,
we read good books, prayed that the Lord would be our director,
and felt that we were journeying to the place which the Lord had
prepared for those that love and serve his name.&nbsp; I had
often heard Mr. Adams express himself, that Mr. Breame Skepper
was to him a guide, a counsellor, and friend, but now he was
taken away no more to counsel, and to comfort, and direct.&nbsp;
These are some of the mysterious dispensations of a wise and
loving Father, and although we are not now permitted to know the
whys and the wherefores, yet we shall know hereafter, enough is
for the present revealed, that we may trust in the Lord, and stay
ourselves upon his gracious assurances, and surely &ldquo;All
things work together for good to them that love God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ought to have observed that one of the first acts performed
by Mr. Denniss was to build a gallery at the west end of the
Church, for the accommodation of the working men; in this he was
assisted by others, as the subjoined inscription
witnesseth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;This gallery was erected at the expense of the
patron and some of the principal landowners of the parish, A.D.,
1836.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Edwin P.

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Henry
Youngman</span>, <span class="smcap">Breame Skepper</span>,
<i>Churchwardens</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next he had to superintend the building of a Rectory House,
this took place 1837&ndash;8; it was accomplished, and a very
handsome and convenient house it looks, but it was not for the
enjoyment of its builder very long, and while I am writing it has
been the residence of three rectors beside Mr. Denniss, who was a
working clergymen, and no doubt felt whilst he was industriously
promoting habits of thrift and economy among the working classes,
and founding what was called a clothing club, he was doing the
work of the Lord, yet it was thought and said that too much of it
was transacted on the day of the Lord; in other respects it was a
means of drawing the common people to church, where much of this
business was transacted, and carnal things took the place of
spiritual.</p>
<p>Other great events occurred during that memorable year
1837.&nbsp; Our King William IV. whose health had been for some
months in a precarious state, died at Windsor, on the 20th of
June, after a short reign of seven years.&nbsp; There was a large
gathering at St. Peter&rsquo;s Chapel on the day of the funeral,
a solemn service was conducted by Mr. Cunningham, the vicar, the
text was from <i>Micah</i> vi. 9, &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s voice
crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name,
hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our good Queen Victoria was proclaimed on the day following,
as sovereign of these realms, and on the 28th of June, in the
following year, 1838, the coronation of Her Majesty took place
amidst great rejoicing.</p>
<p>My affianced still resided at Yarmouth, and during that summer
she came on a holiday to see her parents, <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and I
obtained leave of absence to meet her there, that we might talk
over our present affairs and also the future, as to continuing in
service or declining that position and commencing a boot and shoe
business on our own account, and ultimately the latter was
decided on, and we returned to our homes to complete our
engagements, and to apprize our superiors that we declined to
remain in their service after the coming Michaelmas, things were
thus far plain and understandable.</p>
<p>As a beginning to make preparations for the change in my
condition, I hired a cottage and garden of Mr. Johnson George,
miller of Oulton, at &pound;6 per year, and on the 16th day of
October, 1838, was married to Hannah Cox, whose parents resided
in the village.&nbsp; Mr. Denniss was the clergyman and Mr. John
Osborn was clerk of the aforesaid parish.</p>
<p>I am now arrived at something like the middle of my journey,
and will just take a retrospect, all the way the Lord my God hath
led me, to guard me, to try me, to prove me, and to see what is
in mine heart.&nbsp; Now let me just ask myself am I
thankful?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When all thy mercies, O my God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My rising soul surveys.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is my heart filled with gratitude for all those supports and
deliverances?&nbsp; And then again as to the prospect here, I
stand as it were on a narrow neck of land with boundless seas on
either side, if God preserves I am perfectly safe, but if left to
follow the devices and inclination of my corrupt and stubborn
heart, shall be weighed down with perplexing cares and sorrows,
out of which it is no easy matter to be delivered, except by
divine interposition, then looking onward I must labour, working
with hands and mind, to obtain the bread that perisheth, as also
that which endureth unto <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>eternal life, being identified with
and living in Him who is the bread of life which came down from
heaven.</p>
<p>I may just say in passing, that the housekeeper, Marianne
Rous, was soon after married to Christopher Leman, a cooper of
Lowestoft, the mistress, also, after a little while went forth
from her residence, and during her temporary absence was married
to Mr. George Borrow.&nbsp; That gentleman having visited several
times while I was in Mrs. Clarke&rsquo;s services, although, by
the way, I knew not the secret.</p>
<p>I had now to look out for employment.&nbsp; Mr. Winyard
promised to give me some, so after it I went, and soon got up a
little connection at home; all wanted boots and I wanted to work
and obtain the money, although in this I was often
disappointed.&nbsp; I soon taught my wife to work in the boot
trade, the work was all performed by hand in those days, machines
had not come into use, and although I could not undertake to bind
women&rsquo;s boots, yet I knew the method by which they were
done, as also the materials required for the purpose, the
difficulty was soon overcome; she was blessed with good eyesight
as well as with very pliant fingers, and after a year or two she
would do neater work in even men&rsquo;s boots and shoes than I
could: there was a willing mind and thus obstacles were overcome;
customers were accommodated, the little business obtained an
impetus, and the earnest and humble promoters received
encouragement.</p>
<p>When harvest arrived, my wife prepared to go out in the fields
gleaning, and gathered up two or three bushels of good wheat,
which was a great help, as during first year of housekeeping
flour was two shillings and ninepence per stone, even that was
trying to young beginners, for there was in reality a good number
of things wanting, and our little trade seemed to absorb <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the cash in
the purchase of materials, so that we had but little left for
food and other necessaries.&nbsp; However, under the blessing of
God we made progress, having more than a handful of meal in a
barrel, and more than two sticks to refresh the languishing fire,
the Lord did provide.</p>
<p>There was a large pear tree in our garden, two nice apple
trees, and a cherry tree, all bringing a little delicious fruit;
we had not many pears the first year, but the second year there
was a good crop, and we sold more than twenty shilling&rsquo;s
worth, beside what we gave away and used ourselves.&nbsp; I built
a pigsty and put a pig in, that my wife might have something to
look at when she walked in the garden, the pig settled and did
nicely, and when it was killed it weighed 13 stone; we were
cheered as the pig prospered, we felt we prospered also, and no
doubt we did begin to get on nicely while we occupied the cottage
and premises of Mr. Johnson George, at Oulton.</p>
<p>We bought and put in the front room of our cottage, a register
stove, three-feet square, the selling price was one shilling per
inch, costing &pound;1 15s., landlord supplying a new chimney
piece, and we put up an iron oven in the back room, but we did
not continue in that occupation very long, we spent four seasons
of Christmas there, when, their son Henry being about to be
married we had to leave and make room for the old people, who, by
the way, had to make room for the younger ones.&nbsp; We agreed
to go, and leave behind the stove which is still in the room,
after forty years use.&nbsp; We took away the iron oven to
another cottage, which I engaged of Mrs. Pleasance Knights at the
rent of &pound;4 10s. per year; at that time standing empty, the
next tenement being also empty, they would not stand empty now if
owners wished them occupied.&nbsp; This was rather a convenient
old cottage, it supplied a room <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>on the front side, which I could use
for a workshop, which was a great accommodation, and at
Christmas, that is on the 6th of January, 1842, we left Mr.
George&rsquo;s cottage, as requested, and took our goods and
chattels to Mrs. Knights&rsquo;s cottage, on the hill, and
although it was sometimes a sad place for smoking, yet we had a
good share of employment, and on the whole, although we met with
some who were not at all times inclined to act uprightly, yet
there was a good preponderance of honesty in the neighbourhood,
men and women on whose acts and promises we could rely.</p>
<p>For several years I took out work from Mr. Winyard, so that
there was no want of employment.&nbsp; Here again I must build a
pigsty by the roadside, and it was soon inhabited, and by some
thought to be too near the house, but we received no harm among
the boots and wax and other materials; customers would talk and
pigs would shriek the while, so that we were not always silent
and sorrowful.&nbsp; The garden here contained several nice fruit
trees, but no pear tree, another drawback was there was no water
to the house, but we could have as much as we wanted by fetching
it from Mrs. Knights&rsquo;s across the road, and we could catch
some in rainy weather.&nbsp; We purchased a shop stove, and made
a hole through the brickwork into the chimney, so that we could
often live on that side when the other room was smoky, we found
the comfort of this as an impediment was removed.&nbsp; In the
year 1840, I was appointed steward of an institution called the
&ldquo;Pakefield Friendly Society,&rdquo; the duties of which was
to receive the contributions of the members in my district, and
also the applications for membership, and bring them up to the
monthly meetings held at Lowestoft, on the first Tuesday evening
of each month, from six to eight.</p>
<p>I was very successful in obtaining employment, worked closely,
and began to have what might be said <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>to be a good connection, so much so
that I could not get through with it myself, and as
customers&rsquo; patience began to wear out I set on James Jacobs
as journeyman.&nbsp; My wife done a good part in helping on with
the uppers, so that we went fairly into business and made long
days of work.&nbsp; About this time there was a poor woman in
Lowestoft, a Mrs. Parr, who was afflicted with insanity, and had
become sometimes violent and almost unmanageable, we were asked
if we would take the charge of her, and do our best to keep her
from harm for a time, as they were afraid lest she might do harm
to herself or to some other persons: my wife, after an interview
with her medical attendant, Mr. Worthington, came to the
conclusion that she would make the trial.&nbsp; The terms were
fixed for board and attendance, and the money was duly paid at
the house of Mr. B. Edmonds, a chemist, at Lowestoft.&nbsp; She
came as arranged, my heart was overwhelmed to witness such a
spectacle of human infirmity, of one whom I had known and who
always appeared to be so cheerful and clever, but afflictions,
though severe, are designed to bring about the purposes of
Infinite Wisdom and Love; neither my wife nor myself rested much
the first week: she sung, concocted rhymes and comparisons, for
three days and three nights without sleep, we were supplied with
a heavy chair for her use during the day, and an appliance called
a muff, to secure her hands during the time she was in bed,
otherwise she would have been gone when those in charge were
taking a little rest in sleep, we many times wished we had not
taken her, but being there she had to remain until other
arrangements could be made.&nbsp; Her friends visited her and
appeared satisfied though sorrowful, and after being with us one
year, her friends arranged that she should be an indoor-patient
at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, an institution in London, for the
treatment of such cases; she was there for one year, and
ultimately was removed to Melton Asylum, her last earthly
residence.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Now is
coming on the construction of a new railroad from Lowestoft to
Reedham.&nbsp; Great preparations are being made, materials, and
men, and horses, and implements, are deposited in the locality,
besides temporary dwellings for the overlookers and gangers; we
in this neighbourhood never having seen the like.&nbsp; It was a
marvellous undertaking, but day by day we witnessed the skilful
operations of the workmen, several of whom made their place of
rest with us during the time the work was in progress, my wife
cooking for them day by day, and otherwise preparing their food
and making their beds.</p>
<p>Mr. Denniss, having built the rectory house, the school,
appointed teachers, removed old buildings and various other
things by way of improvement in our parish, to him
assigned.&nbsp; In 1845, his effects were sold by public auction,
and the man and his family took their departure after a brief
stay of nine years.&nbsp; He was succeeded by Chas. Henry Cox, an
earnest, solemn clergyman, whose aim was to &ldquo;point us to
brighter worlds, and lead the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the father
of a large family, but his gentle and kind christian bearing told
powerfully upon the minds of the people under his charge.</p>
<p>The dangerous operations of making the railroad was carried
on, one of my lodgers was killed while making the road.&nbsp; I
made a note of it at the time of the occurrence, which is this:
Inquest held at Mr. Beaumont&rsquo;s, Mutford Bridge, before J.
E. Sparrowe, Esq., August 20th, 1846, on the body of John Smith,
my esteemed lodger, who was unfortunately killed by a railroad
waggon accidently passing over his body, on Tuesday, the 18th, a
sad and painful event to those who witnessed it.&nbsp; In
February of the following year, my wife&rsquo;s mother was taken
suddenly ill, and after a few hours expired, leaving a sorrowful
family to mourn their loss, a mysterious dispensation of Divine
Providence, unfathomable to us short-sighted mortals, <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>but loudly
speaking to all who have ears to hear, &ldquo;Arise, depart, for
this is not your rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had now plenty of work for myself and journeyman, my work
suited the navvies as well as others, and I had also a good share
of orders from the master, Mr. Kershaw, who generally undertook
to supply boots to those that travelled with him, making
railroads, according to the pattern worn by the men on the
work.&nbsp; They also supplied slops, shirts, and caps, and
almost all articles of food, as also that important beverage
strong beer, for which they held an out-door licence, as those
men were real guzzlers, and when the end of the fortnight
arrived, they had not much money to take home to their
lodgings.&nbsp; They were evidently not a saving class of men,
and did not take much care about the salvation of their immortal
souls.&nbsp; But that good philanthropist, Mr. Peto, the
benefactor of Lowestoft and its neighbourhood, engaged Mr.
Johnson, as a sort of home Missionary, to go amongst the people
and speak a word of warning and of counsel to them, and also to
distribute interesting books among them, which they could read or
hear read at their lodgings.&nbsp; This was a very praiseworthy
act of that generous man, who, although they could not recompense
him, yet he will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just,
for the which he is content to wait.&nbsp; In course of time the
railroad was constructed to Reedham, to join the Yarmouth and
Norwich line, and thence passengers and cattle were conveyed to
the Metropolis.</p>
<p>Mr. Cox, our rector, was very assidious in his visits among
his parishioners, and did as much as he could to ameliorate their
condition, notwithstanding the claims of home, so that his visits
were generally appreciated.&nbsp; He used to be absent from his
home a week in two months, and it was said he had an engagement
out, a duty to perform one Sunday in a month.&nbsp; On one of
those outward distant attendances <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>he was taken sick and died, and never
came here again, his body was buried at Great Marlow, in
Buckingham.&nbsp; Here then the shepherd was suddenly separated
from his flock, the husband from the wife, and the father from
his family, not knowing why they are thus bereft of a friend, a
guide, and a counsellor; they are comforted to know that he is
taken away in the midst of his usefulness, and that his happy
spirit has passed through the gates of the New Jerusalem and
joined the Church Triumphant above, where there are joys for
evermore.&nbsp; Thus it pleases our Heavenly Father sometimes to
gather his children at a comparatively early age, while others,
who have a larger field of usefulness to occupy on earth, are
detained from their crown, until full of years and good
works.&nbsp; Each of these is then gathered &ldquo;as a shock of
corn cometh in in his season,&rdquo; and further, here is the
gracious assurance, &ldquo;Even to your old age I am he, and even
to hoary hairs will I carry you; I have made and I will bear,
even I will carry and I will deliver
you.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i> xlvi. 4.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Pakefield Friendly Society&rdquo; had continued to
flourish under well regulated management.&nbsp; Annual statements
were made, and circulated amongst the members, the greatest
number of whom is reported in 1855, exactly thirty years from its
formation, the number being 363 while its highest amount of
capital is reported in 1863, &pound;4,964, and from that time the
fund was each successive year reported to be less, and in 1868,
five years later, was &pound;4,288, &pound;676 having been
expended over its income, which told very plainly the society was
not in a solvent condition.&nbsp; On the 11th day of June, 1850,
several plots of building ground were offered for sale by
auction, Messrs. Norton and Reeve were vendor&rsquo;s solicitors,
I bought two of those plots for the sum of &pound;58, thinking
perhaps I might erect a dwelling thereon, as I had hitherto been
glad to hire a cottage for my use, but even in that matter <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>I had been
very fairly accommodated.&nbsp; I now took an apprentice, John
Crowther, that he might learn to make boots, he was rather a
sharp lad, and we got on together very fairly.&nbsp; Early in
1851, another new rector, Mr. Hunter Francis Fell, came to our
parish, with four daughters, who very laudably acted as curates
in taking the oversight of the parish, and carrying on the
infants&rsquo; and adults&rsquo; schools with commendable and
praiseworthy efforts.</p>
<p>I was now busily engaged in preparing to build two cottages
and a workshop, having taken in 10,000 bricks the previous autumn
that they might be ready for spring work.&nbsp; Mr. Saml. Neslen,
of Lowestoft, was my carpenter, and Mr. Thomas Swatman, Sen., my
bricklayer, we went in for building in good earnest, as something
must be accomplished in the way of building by the roadside near
Mutford Bridge.&nbsp; My wife&rsquo;s youngest sister was
appointed to attend the school as governess, but it was soon
found her nerves were not sufficiently strong, her rest was
broken, which threatened to undermine her health, my wife was
invited to attend for a time, and see how her sister went on, she
did not become at all strong, and consequently my wife was
permanently engaged as mistress of the school, and I was engaged
in superintending the building of cottages destined to become our
future residence.&nbsp; This year was noted for the great
exhibition in Hyde Park, the world&rsquo;s fair.&nbsp; I had
several invitations to go to witness that large gathering, but my
time and money was required in other directions, thinking that
building might be the only one that I should have an opportunity
of ever again being engaged in on my own account.&nbsp; The new
rector soon felt at home in the parish, ready to speak a healing
word and perform a kind act, when he heard the voice of sorrow
from without, for he knew that &ldquo;the sorry of the world
worketh death.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was desirous that his flock <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>should
&ldquo;abound in every thing in faith, utterance, knowledge, and
in all diligence, and also in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the summer my cottages and shop were completed, I gave
up my former cottage and came to reside in one of them, which was
light, and bright, and airy, and I thought it a great mark of
Divine favour that this marvellous piece of work had been
accomplished.&nbsp; Now again more than ever the boot trade
engrossed my attention: I worked on, the trade did not fail, it
was said that machines were being invented which would do the
work quick, and hand work would be at a discount.&nbsp; I was not
troubled at this.&nbsp; I felt that my Heavenly Father had opened
the way for me, and that the same kindness and favour would be
continued; my duly was clear to be &ldquo;diligent in business,
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was
enough work to employ me a whole year or more: gardens to be
arranged, fences to be removed, ground to be levelled and
planted, walls and outbuildings to be constructed, and altogether
such a metamorphosis as fixed me and others in wonderment as to
how it all had been brought about.&nbsp; After having done as
much as was necessary to the new places for a time, and as there
was no time for idleness, heads and hands must work in earnest,
while the eyesight is good.</p>
<p>Another lad now came to me to be instructed, John Mays: he
suffered from lameness in his hip, but his hands and eyes were
free, and with those two lads and a journeyman, we got through a
good quantity of work.</p>
<p>Mr. Fell visited me and approved of my building and
arrangements, he said it was a very pleasant and open healthy
neighbourhood, hoping it would be appreciated by its owners, and
good and lasting health enjoyed by its attendants and
tenants.</p>
<p>In 1837, I, with George Nobbs, were appointed constables of
the parish: the duties were to preserve <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>order, to go
to the public houses if sent for, and to attend upon the coroner
and summon the jurors in case of inquests.</p>
<p>There were four inquests during my two years of service.&nbsp;
The first was at the &ldquo;Boar Inn,&rdquo; Oulton, on the 25th
of May, 1857, before J. K. Sparrowe, Esq., coroner, on the body
of Robt. Baldry, who was killed by the wheel of a tumbril passing
over his head.&nbsp; The second was taken at the &ldquo;House of
Industry,&rdquo; on the 9th day of October, 1857, before B. L.
Gross, Esq., deputy-coroner, on the body of William Jinkerson,
aged 47 years, who fell down and expired.&nbsp; The third was
taken at the &ldquo;Wherry Inn,&rdquo; on the 14th day of
November, 1857, before J. E. Sparrowe, Esq., on the body of
George Wade, who was drowned accidently during the thick darkness
of November 10th.&nbsp; The fourth was taken at the house of Mr.
Thomas Roe Woods, on the 20th day of April, 1858, before J. E.
Sparrowe, Esq., on the body of William Mace, who was killed by
the horn of a bullock, which pierced the front of his head, on
the premises of Mr. Woods.</p>
<p>This year, 1858, the East Suffolk Railway was forwarded in
good earnest, the piles driven in the water to support the bridge
were all driven by the 31st of August, ready to bear its
burden.&nbsp; The bridge being done the first load of earth
passed over November 26th, the first engine passed over on the
17th of December, first train of carriages passed over on the
25th of February, 1859, and was afterwards opened for public
traffic as a railway, on the 1st of June.</p>
<p>During this year Mr. Barnard built the chapel at the corner in
Carlton Colville, and it was opened on the 6th day of September
for Divine worship, the preachers were Mr. Alfred Bourne, in the
afternoon, and Mr. John Alexander, in the evening, who choose for
his text on that occasion <i>Matthew</i> vii, 7, 8, in which the
venerable man exhorted his hearers, that having obtained this
house of prayer, there were still other <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>blessings
they needed that they might grow in grace and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He also enlarged on the
privileges brought by the gospel, a great
festival&mdash;&ldquo;Redemption by the blood of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the one grand blessing which
comprehends all other blessings.&nbsp; The table is always
spread, the company are always welcome, the season is always
pleasant, and the joy is always new, we were to pray for a
spiritual appetite that we might enjoy this feast, be fed
continually with the bread of life, and drink of the wine of
heavenly consolation, no longer to entertain an appetite for the
vanities of the world, but that with the Psalmist have the Lord
for our Shepherd, leading us by green pastures and still waters,
that we may rise to sit at that table, which is for ever spread
in heaven.</p>
<p>The new chapel services were appreciated, a goodly number
attended each Sabbath from the Oulton side of the bridge, as also
in the Carlton district, where the chapel was erected, the
churches, in those respective parishes being a long distance from
thence.&nbsp; The residents of the locality having taken counsel
together resolved to present a testimonial to Mr. Barnard, for
the great kindness he had conferred, and on Wednesday evening,
the 4th January, 1860, a large assembly, including several
friends from Lowestoft, met at the chapel, and presented that
gentleman with &ldquo;Dr. Kittos Commentory on the Bible,&rdquo;
together with a handsome table lamp, hoping that himself and Mrs.
Barnard might be spared many years to investigate its sacred
truths, which some of us, who were present on that interesting
occasion, feel assured has been realised, for although more than
twenty years have rolled away, and some who worshipped with us in
that place are gone to their rest, yet the founder and Mrs. B.
survives, and the chapel services are being continued, and we
hope also by many enjoyed, knowing the Great Master&rsquo;s
service is perfect freedom.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>May
28th was the severest gale in this season ever remembered: Four
mackerel boats were missing from Lowestoft with all their crews,
and also two cutters (carriers).&nbsp; As the 18th of June
arrived, all hope was abandoned.&nbsp; Six from our town, boats
and cutters, and eleven from Yarmouth and Gorleston, with a loss
of about 200 hands!&nbsp; Nine of them belonged to the parish of
Oulton.&nbsp; The evening of the 21st October, was very
remarkable for changes.&nbsp; In the short space of two hours we
had thunder, lightning, rain, hail, snow, wind, and frost,
accomplished by an Almighty power.&nbsp; An aged and sincere
friend, who had preached to us many times in Mr. Barnard&rsquo;s
chapel, whom we called &ldquo;Captain Ducker,&rdquo; was called
to his rest January 20th, 1861, aged 70 years.&nbsp; His last
service with us was on the evening of Sunday, December 23rd of
the preceding year.&nbsp; And it might be truly said of him, as
was recorded of Barnabas:&mdash;&ldquo;He was a good man, and
full of the Holy Ghost and of faith,&rdquo; rejoicing to see
believers added to the Lord, and walking in fellowship, as
children of a King.</p>
<p>Another solemn event took place in our parish.&nbsp; Mr. Fell,
rector of Oulton, died at Worldham, Hants, on Sunday, November
10, aged 71 years, having held the living from 1851.&nbsp; Here,
then, we see merciful men taken away; and, when rightly
considered, they are taken from the evil to come.&nbsp; My wife
had conducted the school through the late rector&rsquo;s
incumbency, and is still going on with the same.&nbsp; The Prince
Consort died on the 14th of December, and was buried on the 23rd
of the same month.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>God moves in a mysterious way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wonders to perform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;His ways are past finding out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord, make me to know the measure of my days, that I may
know how frail I am,&rdquo; and, further, that I may be prepared
for that great and solemn change, which I feel sure must soon
arrive.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>In
January, 1862, Mr. Charles Snell was presented to the living at
Oulton, vacant by the death of Mr. Fell.&nbsp; He comes into
residence, and finds out the relative position of his
parishioners, the domestic comforts of some, and the troubles and
mishaps, and cares and sorrows of others, all needing a word of
counsel, as also a word of consolation, and thus they are
supported amidst the trials and conflicts of this mortal life,
which are almost continually pressing upon them.&nbsp; Here,
then, the good man is inducted into the living.</p>
<blockquote><p>He asks the aid of heavenly power,<br />
To guard him in the evil hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And resolves to warn and teach, according to the standard of
divine truth, and resolved to exemplify the bearing of a
Christian minister, by the grace of God.&nbsp; To show
unequivocally and impressively that &ldquo;all have sinned and
come short of the glory of God,&rdquo; and then comes free
justification by His grace, through the redemption that is in
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; He takes his safe stand upon this doctrine,
and affirms that it is &ldquo;God who hath set forth Jesus Christ
to be a propitiation, through faith in His blood, to declare His
righteousness for the remission of sins, that are past through
the forbearance of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And should he be asked,
&ldquo;Is the blood of Christ sufficient to atone for the whole
world?&rdquo; he replies, &ldquo;Quite so; but only
<i>efficient</i> to save those who being justified by faith,
enjoy also peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as the apostle Paul asserts, in his
fifth chapter of Romans:&mdash;&ldquo;By whom we have now
received the atonement.&rdquo;&nbsp; Truly, this is the comfort
wherewith we desire to be always comforted.</p>
<p>Mr. Dovey, the Baptist minister at Lowestoft, preached his
first sermon in that town in December, 1844, and continued his
ministrations for seventeen years.&nbsp; His last sermon, as
pastor was delivered February 23rd, 1862.&nbsp; Mr. Aldis, his
successor, came to <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Lowestoft in the same year.&nbsp; Mr. G. S. Crisp died
on the 30th May, 1863, at the age of 79 years.&nbsp; This good
man was for many years a preacher of the gospel at the
Congregational Chapel, at Lowestoft, and for many years came and
preached the word of life at Carlton Colville, and was so engaged
at the time the new chapel was built, although soon afterwards
called to put off the clay tabernacle, and enter into his rest,
of which he had long been seeking and preaching in days that were
past.&nbsp; Here, then, the gospel has been preached; sinners
have been warned and invited; Jesus Christ hath been set forth as
a willing Saviour.&nbsp; But, alas!&nbsp; There are so many who
think the gospel is so far beneath their attention they cannot
understand how it pleases God, by the foolishness of preaching,
to save them that believe.&nbsp; They refuse to believe that the
gospel is of God, and that they are bound to receive it, and must
not cavil or raise objections.&nbsp; It is for the acceptance of
all who possess any views worth having, and those who still
continue to neglect this great salvation will in the end find
that it will grind them to powder.&nbsp; Such was the sad
experience of that infatuated and misguided wretch who on the
14th April of this year fell by the hand of the executioner, at
Ipswich, for the murder of Ebenezer Tye, at Halesworth.</p>
<p>Having now commenced the fifth year of the chapel services at
Carlton, it is suggested that a testimonial be presented to Mr.
Hinde, expressive of the appreciation of the attendance as to the
spiritual services supplied by that gentleman, and ably conducted
by him in that House of Prayer.&nbsp; On the evening of Friday,
the 15th of January, 1866, a handsome writing cabinet was
presented to Mr. Hinde, at the chapel, a large gathering having
met on that interesting occasion.&nbsp; I do not exactly remember
if the number of services were announced that Mr. Hinde had
conducted, but it shall be recorded here with gladness:&mdash;<a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>During the
first year 31 services; second year 51; third year, 46; fourth,
56; and to January 15th, 17; then to the end of the fifth year,
39, making again 56; and these numbers are all exclusive of week
evening services, and afterwards they were successfully
continued, and we believe are so still.&nbsp; But before I quite
take leave of my Carlton friends, I am reminded that there was
another earnest and devoted servant of God, a veteran in the
Master&rsquo;s service, and who usually shared each service with
his friend, Captain Ducker&mdash;I allude now to Mr. Delf, of
Lowestoft, who is also gone to his rest.&nbsp; Their last united
service was on the evening of November 4th, 1860.&nbsp; We
admired the vigilance of the two good and faithful evangelists,
who desired to be found instant in season&mdash;yea! and out of
season!&mdash;so that they might finish their course with joy,
and serving their generation, by the will of God, entered into
rest.</p>
<p>There is just one other incident I cannot pass over in
connection with Carlton Chapel.&nbsp; The friends, organised a
series of special services, called &ldquo;Revival
Meetings,&rdquo; in which the writer took part.&nbsp; They were
seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord.&nbsp; The
first was held on the evening of March 18th, 1861; the second,
March 20th; the third, March 25th; the fourth, March 26th; the
fifth, April 3rd: the sixth, April 12th; the seventh, April 17th;
the eighth, April 24th, and the last of those services was
performed on the evening of the 1st May&mdash;happy sacred
seasons, and were by some long remembered, and thanking the
friends who came to Carlton, I will now take my leave.</p>
<p>Again, as I remember to have taken leave of the Vicar of
Lowestoft&mdash;Mr. Cunningham&mdash;who always took a lively
interest in the Pakefield Friendly Society, of which I was still
agent, under Mr. Henry Seppings, as secretary, having served
under two secretaries previously, who had been removed from the
office.&nbsp; There <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>were generally those present at our meetings who were
pleased to witness the good man&rsquo;s smiles, and to hear a few
courteous words in furtherance of the well being of the society,
which were always well received.&nbsp; I will here insert the
inscription on his tomb:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Sacred to the Memory of</span><br />
FRANCIS CUNNINGHAM,<br />
42 Years Rector of Pakefield, and from 1830 till within a few<br
/>
months of his death, Vicar of Lowestoft,<br />
Born July 27th, 1785; Died August 8th, 1863,<br />
Aged 78 Years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will now close my observations for the present year, by
stating the harvest home festival was celebrated on the 3rd of
September.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of the Lord is in the sea, His paths are in
great waters, and His footsteps are not known.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He bloweth with His wind, and the waters
flow.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have recently witnessed some terrific
gales&mdash;November, 1864.&nbsp; Six steamboats have put into
Lowestoft harbour with a great number of dead cattle on
board.&nbsp; The judgments of the Lord are a great deep, who can
understand?&nbsp; Many scenes of affliction, disappointment,
sorrow, and death beset our path.&nbsp; Martha Bone, of Ryburgh,
Norfolk&mdash;my wife&rsquo;s eldest sister&mdash;suddenly called
away by death, reminding us again to prepare with all
earnestness, for &ldquo;Behold! the Judge standeth at the
door.&rdquo;&nbsp; May the Lord, in His mercy, give us grace to
be so prepared.</p>
<p>I have now before me a charge to a Dissenting minister jotted
down:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.&mdash;Preach Christ crucified, and dwell
chiefly on the blessings resulting from His righteousness,
atonement, and intercession.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;Avoid all needless controversies in the pulpit,
except it be when your subject necessarily requires it, or when
the truths of God are likely to suffer by your silence.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>3.&mdash;When you ascend the pulpit, leave your learning
behind you, if you wish to preach more to the hearts of your
people than to their heads.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;Do not affect too much oratory.&nbsp; Seek rather to
profit than to be admired&mdash;a timely, wholesome,
affectionate, and salutary charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sabbath Schools Union festival was celebrated on Mr.
Crabbbe&rsquo;s lawn, on Tuesday, August 16th, 1864.&nbsp; The
harvest was begun about a week before.</p>
<p>After a lapse of nearly four years, Mr. Samuel Abbott, of
Lowestoft, is again invited to take part in the good work at
Carlton Chapel.</p>
<p>The foundation-stone of the new chapel at Mutford Bridge was
publicly laid on the 30th day of May, 1865, by Mr. Chew, of
Norwich.&nbsp; There was at the time a strong cold wind, blowing
from the west, yet a good number of friends were present on the
occasion.&nbsp; On the 28th June died Martha, the wife of John
Bullard.&nbsp; During the latter years of her life, she walked in
the ways of the Lord.&nbsp; Her conversion was considered to be
brought about by the revival and other religious services at
Carlton Chapel.</p>
<p>The Oulton Chapel (Mutford Bridge) was opened for public
worship on Tuesday, the 12th of September.&nbsp; Mr. Miller
preached in the afternoon; then afterwards a public tea in the
chapel was held, and addresses given in the evening.&nbsp; The
services at this house of prayer are still continued, and many
have found them &ldquo;times of refreshing from the presence of
the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An inquest was held at the &ldquo;Wherry&rdquo; Inn, on the
25th August, before F. B. Marriott, Esq., on the body of William
Codling, aged 16 years, who was drowned by the upsetting of a
boat in Oulton Dyke, on Tuesday, August 22nd, 1865.&nbsp; Here
are again some of the joys and sorrows that beset and bestrew our
pathway.&nbsp; A company of young lads think themselves competent
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>to manage
a sailing boat, but coming home at night the boat upset, its
occupants were immersed in the water, and one of the party
drowned.</p>
<p>Among the events noted down of this year, 1866, the death of
Ann Challis, my wife&rsquo;s youngest sister took place.&nbsp;
She had been afflicted for several years, and died on the evening
of the 22nd January.&nbsp; On the same evening, Charles Cutler
was accidently drowned in Oulton Broad, he having kept the
beer-house at Carlton, near Mr. Bullard&rsquo;s shop several
years.&nbsp; Their bodies were buried on Sunday, January
28th&mdash;my sister in law, at Oulton, and Mr. Cutler at Carlton
Colville, and on the 31st of December of the same year, died
Elizabeth, his wife, so that in their deaths they were not long
divided.</p>
<p>Mr. John Burton, of Lowestoft, fell down his stairs on the
night of Sunday, August 19th, and was so fearfully injured that
he died within ten hours afterwards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dangers stand thick through all our paths,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To push us to the tomb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The harvest of this year was generally begun on the 13th of
August, and it was rather showery during the remainder of the
month, yet we had some bright days, so that the wheat was secured
in good condition, but it was very wet during the month of
September.&nbsp; Wednesday, the 5th, was the only day in that
week suitable for barley carting, and then it rained at six
o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; Thursday, 13th, was the next
fine day; men were employed in lifting and preparing the corn for
carting, only to be followed by a heavy rain next morning, so
that the only day in that week for carting was Saturday, and then
it again rained by six o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp;
Patience and prayers are needed.</p>
<p>The harvest-home festival was unusually late, owing to the
unfavourable state of the weather.&nbsp; The corn <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>could not be
carried before Thursday, September 27th, yet there is still great
cause for thanks that the corn is secured, that provision is made
for our returning winter, and that our Heavenly Father is good
and merciful still, although we are so prone to murmur.</p>
<p>January, 1867, arrives with its abundance of frost and immense
blocks of drifting snow.&nbsp; Two or three of my old neighbours
are removed by death in quick succession&mdash;Archer Beales, the
elder, on January 5th, aged 74; the wife of Robert Newbury was
called home, January 12th; and John Cox, my wife&rsquo;s father,
died on the 19th January, aged 76 years, and buried on Sunday,
27th, having lived a widower 19 years and 11 months.&nbsp; Thus
Death is commissioned to remove us, from the Prince Consort, in
the palace, to the peasant in his humble cot.&nbsp; At this time,
also, is stricken down my old neighbour and friend, George Mobbs,
a man of strict integrity, who served with me in the office of
parish constable, having removed to Mutford, and, after having
lived there five months, died, and was brought to Oulton, and
buried on Sunday, the 10th March.&nbsp; Then, again, at
Lowestoft, Sergeant Hargraves, drill-instructor, is walking out
on Sunday evening, the 5th May, when he was suddenly taken ill
and died, at the age of 41 years, calling to us, who are
survivors of these painful events, that the ways of Jehovah are
far above our finite and limited conception.</p>
<p>A sad event occurred in the spring of this year by the
upsetting of a boat on Oulton Broad.&nbsp; On Good Friday, April
10th, 1868, a party of three young men engaged a boat, that they
might amuse themselves upon the water.&nbsp; The wind on that day
became strong, and, themselves unskilful in managing it, very
soon overturned, and all were immersed in the water, two of
them&mdash;James Ellis Fisk and John Knights&mdash;both aged 18,
were drowned.&nbsp; It was a sad spectacle the jury were called
to view, as they were laid side by <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>side, prepared for burial.&nbsp;
Their life had vanished as a dream, when one awaketh.</p>
<p>My two new cottages were built this year; they were begun on
Thursday, the 5th March, and in due time were completed.&nbsp;
This was a remarkably hot and dry summer, as by a note to
hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been a very long drought, June passing
almost without rain.&nbsp; A little fell on the 2nd., and now we
are arrived at the 17th of July, and on this day it has pleased
God, in His mercy, to command the rain to descend in abundance,
with a sharp tempest, the two previous days having been very
hot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The harvest was generally begun on the 24th of July, and at
Mr. Barnard&rsquo;s farm, at Carlton, the whole of the corn was
gathered in by the 30th of that month, and the harvest-home
festival celebrated at Oulton, on the 20th August.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s only brother, who had been suffering from
consumption for a long time, died October 8th at Lowestoft, aged
46 years, leaving a widow and four children to mourn their
bereavement.&nbsp; We took the second boy under our charge, and
kept him seven years.&nbsp; During that interval, his two
brothers had died, and only him and his sister was left.&nbsp;
Edmund Challis, my wife&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband, was
killed by a loaded carriage passing over his body on the 17th of
February, 1869, surviving his first wife only three years.&nbsp;
We know not what a day may bring forth.&nbsp; I happened to meet
that poor man coming from Lowestoft with the loaded wagon, and he
was then riding, not thinking that would be the last time that I
should see him, but it proved to be so, and he is gone.&nbsp;
There is a piece of ground adjoining my garden, containing about
40 perches, and belonging to Mr. Knights.&nbsp; That gentleman
was willing to treat with me as to the purchase of the same, and
we agreeing, I became the purchaser thereof for &pound;45, and
had the pump put down thereon in the month of May, having <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>found, and
still continuing to find a good supply of pure water&mdash;thanks
to the Giver of all good.&nbsp; It is delightful to live and walk
in the shining of God&rsquo;s countenance; but to die in the
light and consolation of his presence is the crowning mercy of
all.&nbsp; How gracious is the Holy Spirit of Promise to shine
away the doubts and fears of His people, and put them to bed by
daylight!&nbsp; O, may it be more and more my privilege to taste
the sweetness of His love, rise into a nearer conformity to His
image; enjoy closer communion with Him, and experience an
increasing sense of his never-failing faithfulness, and catch a
glimpse of that page in the Book of Life, whereon is written my
unworthy name.</p>
<p>The year of 1870 brings with it many incidents peculiar to our
position.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man walketh in a vain shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On February 7th, Mr. Robert Morris, a chemist at Lowestoft, and
one, who when young, attended at the same school with myself (Mr.
Goodwin&rsquo;s, at Laxfield) died at the age of 59.&nbsp; Thus
my old schoolfellows are receding from view.&nbsp; I know not now
where to find half a dozen.&nbsp; O, let me be thankful for the
mercies bestowed upon me.&nbsp; We had very little rain from the
first Monday in May to the last Saturday in June.&nbsp; My old
neighbour, John Adams, who had served his generation, by the will
of God, fell asleep on the 14th day of July, and was gathered to
his rest at the age of 85 years.&nbsp; The harvest was generally
begun on the 12th August, but the weather was very fickle.&nbsp;
A thunderstorm came on the night of Thursday, 18th, and from that
time to the end of the following week, we had rain every day, and
on Sunday, 28th, as much rain fell as had fallen during the week
previous, so that rain continued, with slight intermission for 12
days, and harvest was scarcely concluded by September 8th, the
celebration of the harvest-home of that year.</p>
<p>An inquest was held at the Wherry Inn, on the 23rd <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>day of
August, before Dr. Pearson, on the body of James Gibbs, aged 12
years, who was drowned by the breaking of a hook rope on board a
wherry, sailing on Oulton Broad, on Saturday, August 20th.&nbsp;
This was but a short course, from the cradle to the grave, from
suffering and from sin, for ever emancipated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Teach
me, O Lord, the way of Thy statutes, and make me keep it unto the
end, and by Thy grace cause me to finish the work thou hast given
me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Edward Leathes, of Normanstone, was called away by death
on the 11th February, 1871&mdash;the day after a great
snowstorm&mdash;aged 75.</p>
<p>Having secured the piece of ground before-mentioned, and
settled all demands for the same, in which my wife concurred, and
assisted, and having made and executed a will, making everything
that I possessed over to her for her own use, benefit, and
enjoyment, the same being duly attested by Henry Bull and his
wife, matters having been thus satisfactorily arranged, I
afterwards suggested to my wife, in sincere fidelity, that if she
could and would supply twenty pounds, I would do the rest, and
build thereon a nice cottage, and she should have the full power
to do with it as to choosing her own tenants, and other matters
in connection therewith, as long as she should live.&nbsp; My
proposal was indignantly rejected, the motive was grieviously
maligned and aspersed.&nbsp; I drove on heavily, as if my wheels
were impeded.&nbsp; Nevertheless I borrowed &pound;25 of a
friend, and built a cottage, and let it to a tenant for a time,
and the scene here changes.</p>
<p>An inquest was held at the Wherry Inn, on the 15th August,
before Dr. Pearson, deputy-coroner, on the body of George Copsey
Nelson who was drowned while bathing in Oulton Broad on Sunday,
August 13th.&nbsp; There is something very striking in connection
with this inquest.&nbsp; One of the jurors&mdash;Horace
Martin&mdash;<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>as now investigating a case of drowning, was himself
drowned in the same piece of water before 12 months had passed
away.</p>
<p>I have stated that &pound;25 were borrowed from a
friend.&nbsp; I never had anything to do in connection with loan
societies.&nbsp; I remember to have heard an observation from our
late County Court Judge: &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the people can be so gulled; no sooner do you fail in
paying the instalments, for which you have contracted, when down
comes the office upon the sureties, and if the money is not
forthcoming, your property is seized, and get out of it as you
can, no matter how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will note down here the speedy departure of a few of my
female neighbours:&mdash;Mrs. James Knights died March 6th; Mrs.
William Jacobs died March 27th; Mrs. John Drake died May 24th;
Mrs. John Knights died June 2; Mrs. Nursey, &ldquo;Boar&rdquo;
Inn, died July 10th; Mrs. Stevens died July 21st, aged 56.&nbsp;
The above were all taken from us in 1871, with many others.</p>
<p>Another inquest was held at the &ldquo;Wherry&rdquo; Inn, on
the 27th day of July, 1872, before Mr. F. B. Marriott, coroner,
on the body of Horace Martin, who was accidently drowned by
falling from his yacht, on the 25th.&nbsp; How soon the scene
changes.&nbsp; A few days before all was
anticipated&mdash;happiness and pleasure, the charms and
attractions of the smooth lake, swiftly gliding along in his
frail skiff, unconscious of the swiftness of time, and the
sadness which not unfrequently terminates this mortal life, and
then those precious opportunities which have been so often
disregarded and wasted, are gone for ever.&nbsp; The above
afflictive bereavement was too great to be supported by the
widow.&nbsp; She also died during the following year.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Watch, for ye know not when the time is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The
public auction of Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s effects came off on the
2nd of January, 1873, that gentleman having died a month
previous, November 30th.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Goff, my old master of
harvest, died three weeks later, December 20th.</p>
<p>Again the Coroner held an inquest at the same inn.&nbsp; This
time it was on the body of Joseph Knights son of William
Goldsmith, who was accidentally drowned the previous day from a
boat on Oulton Broad.</p>
<p>By reason of some cross shooting, that have to a certain
extent prevailed, since the cottage was erected, I felt resolved
to dispose of the first built ones&mdash;the six by the road,
with the little one at the back with the gardens, retaining the
last purchase and cottage thereon, to be for the benefit of my
wife, in the event of her being the survivor, she should not be
left destitute.&nbsp; I submitted my burden first to the Lord,
from whom I sought direction.&nbsp; I weighed and pondered over
it again and again.&nbsp; Then I resolved to consult Mr. Chater,
a solicitor at Lowestoft, as to the expediency of a sale, or an
annuity, and which of the two would be most preferable.&nbsp; As
it was not prudent to proceed in too much haste, that gentleman
required a week for consideration of the matter, and then at the
expiration of that time the same subject could be renewed.&nbsp;
During the interval, I made known to my wife what was in
contemplation.&nbsp; It was treated very tamely, as being viewed
by one taking a casual glance from a distant standpoint, as if
the near approach and investigation was far beneath the attention
of one who could for the time being stand aloof, ready to command
an immediate surrender, when, as then thought the proper time had
arrived, or should do so.&nbsp; Eventually, at my next interview
with Mr. Chater, proposals were made as to taking the property
off my hands, which were by me accepted.&nbsp; And, although for
the last few years, property of that description have risen in

class="pagenum">p. 73</span>of that I am glad.&nbsp; Yet
representations have gone forth which have tended to work
prejudice and mischief.&nbsp; I am willing to bend to all these
drawbacks, and at present have never had the least cause to
regret, but am thankful.&nbsp; This, then, I take to be one of
the roads opened to me to walk therein, and in so walking cannot
I see the good hand of my God, for good, for tranquility, after
the bustle and perplexity and cares of business in obtaining my
daily bread; and permitted, also, at times to partake of that
bread which endureth unto eternal life.&nbsp; Here, then, is the
comfort in finding the passage to the grave not only smoother,
but the mind more comforted, being drawn off from worldly cares
and attractions, and, while so favoured, I can think of my fallen
condition, my original depravity from which there is no
deliverance, except by the free grace of the Father, and the
imputed righteousness of a sacrificed Redeemer.&nbsp; This leads
me to prize the bloodshedding, the obedience, and intercession of
the Lord Jesus Christ, the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, who
has come to repair the ruins of the first, and to insist that
&ldquo;except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An inquest was held on Saturday, the 6th day of June, 1874,
before F. B. Marriott, Esq., at the late residence of Charles
Goldsmith, who had hanged himself in his barn the preceding
day.</p>
<p>I am now thinking of relinquishing my business as a boot and
shoemaker, but not in the manner that poor miserable creature has
done, who is mentioned above.&nbsp; I never felt envious at that
kind of prosperity with which he was encompassed, but am
preserved and defended even from my youth up, so that I can
boldly say the Lord is my helper, and He is my strong defence,
and I trust will be so even to the end of my course, which cannot
be far distant, but soberness and vigilance are still needful
lest the enemy of <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>our souls obtain advantage.&nbsp; I need not indulge in
idleness&mdash;a good deal of labour is required to bring my
newly acquired ground into cultivation.&nbsp; Here is the fence
to be planted, a living fence inside, and a wain fence of nine
inches outside, which space I have a right to claim.&nbsp; This,
of which I am now speaking, is the westernmost fence, and is
getting up nicely.&nbsp; Then there were also barrows full of
dandelions to extirminate, and the grass to bury deeply; the
potatoes to plant and mould up that they might be productive, and
many other kinds of garden work to perform, all in keeping with a
healthful and, to some extent, remunerative occupation: and thus
the time glided on.</p>
<p>I have not much to record this year (1875) although many
mercies have been accorded to me, a good state of health, and
privileged to have intercourse with friends, some of them being
at a great distance, and very probably shall behold them no more
in the flesh, yet we are privileged to serve the same God,
&ldquo;one God and Father of all,&rdquo; ever ready to hear
petitions and grant requests.&nbsp; There has lately been some
irregularities practised by two of the members of the Pakefield
Friendly Society in my district.&nbsp; An enquiry was set on
foot, the charge made against them was proved, and the
consequence was that they were both expelled, and all monies
heretofore paid were forfeited to the use of the Society.</p>
<p>Old neighbour Sarah Bales died on the 17th January, having
survived her husband eight years.&nbsp; The good Lord grant us
pardon for our offences, for we lift up our souls unto
Thee.&nbsp; Cast us not away from Thy presence, take not Thy holy
spirit from us, but direct our hearts into Thy love, and our feet
in the way of thy testimonies.&nbsp; Whether we eat or drink, or
whatsoever we do, may we do all to the glory of God, and walk as
seeing Him that is invisible, and may God be the strength of my
heart, the guide of my goings, and my portion for ever and ever,
amen.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Another
inquest was held by the same coroner, on the 15th May, 1875, on
the body of James Paston, who was accidentally drowned in Oulton
Dyke, from off his wherry, the preceding day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
know not when the time is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no doubt but that every believer has his winter
seasons of providential afflictions and of spiritual
distress.&nbsp; Yet if the God of love is ever peculiarly near to
his people for good, it is when His arrows stick fast in them,
and when His hand presseth them sore, and at the time appointed
their consolations return as the clear shining after rain, and
theirs is as the sun when it goeth forth in its might, the
flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of the birds
has come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
land&mdash;the peace of God.</p>
<p>The next inquest took place on Friday, the 20th day of August,
at the &ldquo;Lady of the Lake&rdquo; Hotel, before Mr. William
Ebden, deputy-coroner, on the body of Charles Everitt, aged
eleven years, who was accidentally drowned by the capsizing of a
sailing boat on Oulton Broad, on the afternoon of Wednesday,
August 18th, 1875.&nbsp; How frail the youth, how short the
date.</p>
<p>As I have but little to record as regards my own experience
during this year (1876), I sit down and ponder over a paragraph
of Dr. Dick&rsquo;s Celestial Scenery.&nbsp; He
says:&mdash;&ldquo;There is no contrivance in the system more
wonderful than the rings of Saturn.&nbsp; That these rings should
be separated thirty thousand miles from the body of the planet,
that they should, notwithstanding, accompany the planet in its
revolution round the sun, preserving invariably the same distance
from it, that they should revolve round the planet every ten
hours at the immense velocity of more than a thousand miles in a
minute, and that they should never fly off to the distant regions
of space, <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>nor fall down upon the planet, are circumstances which
required adjustments far mere intricate and exquisite than we can
conceive, and demonstrate that the Almighty Contriver of that
stupendous Appendage to the globe of Saturn is &lsquo;great in
counsel and mighty in operation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet these
adjustments, in whatever they may consist, have been completely
effected.&nbsp; For this planet has been flying through the
regions of space in a regular curve for thousands of years, and
the system of its satellites and rings still remains as at its
first creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. George Cox, the last of my wife&rsquo;s uncles, died at
Lowestoft on the 9th day of April, 1877, aged 71 years, having
survived his wife eleven years and five months: &ldquo;they
desired a better country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The memory of the mother
and father is sweet to surviving children, and we will tread
softly on their graves.&nbsp; The first that was called away
experienced severe affliction for many years, but patiently
endured to the end of her course.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye endure
chastening God dealeth with you as with
sons.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hebrews</i> xii, 7.</p>
<p>Of the father, it might be said when the appointed time had
arrived, the summons was executed more speedily.&nbsp; After only
three days severe illness, although favoured with consciousness
even to the last.&nbsp; On the morning of that day, April 9th, he
made this observation to his daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear
I&rsquo;m going to leave you, but Christ will be with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the day a dear friend came in, and in
conversation suggested, &ldquo;Mr. Cox the pearly gates are ajar
for you,&rdquo; he smilingly replied, &ldquo;not ajar, they stand
wide open&rdquo;; then singing &ldquo;There are Angels hovering
round,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rock of Ages cleft for me&rdquo; <i>for
me</i>.&nbsp; Again he said to his beloved daughter, &ldquo;My
dear this is victory over death: I am passing over the river dry
shod, my end is peace, Jesus hath wiped away all
tears.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then urging all to love Jesus and meet him in
heaven, he requested all present to kneel in earnest and humble
prayer around <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>his bed, and afterwards raising his hands calmly replied
&ldquo;<i>I am coming</i>, <i>I am coming</i>,&rdquo; and his
happy spirit took its flight to be for ever with the Lord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherefore comfort one another with these words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Flaxman, another of my old neighbours, died at
Lowestoft on the above date, April 9th, 1877.&nbsp; And also yet
another taken in the same week, Mrs. Sarah Morris (late Suggate,)
fell down the stairs in her house, and was afterwards found quite
dead.&nbsp; But the most joyous testimony is, they all died in
the faith, and through that grace having obtained a good report,
have now entered into possession of what they here held in
reversion, a promise of the life to come.&nbsp; The children of
God have sometimes comfortable anticipations of the glory that
shall be revealed when faith pierces within the veil, whither
Jesus our forerunner is gone before, and as in the language of
the spies of old, &ldquo;We have seen the land and behold it is
very good, when shall we go up and take possession.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;When shall we get through the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. John Knights, of whom I had bought my piece of land, died
December 2nd, 1877.</p>
<p>When shall we receive the end of our faith, even the full
salvation of our souls?&nbsp; How long, O Lord, holy and true?
why tarry the wheels of thy chariot? return unto thy rest, O my
soul, the Lord deals bountifully.</p>
<p>Inquest held at the &ldquo;Lady of the Lake&rdquo; Inn, on the
body of Emily Charlotte, daughter of William Scarll, aged 5
years, who was mortally injured by the wheel of a cart passing
over her body, on the 12th of August, 1878, during a sharp
thunderstorm, she died on the 18th, and the inquest was held on
the 20th, before C. W. Chaston, Esq., coroner.&nbsp; The parents
are sorrowful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When virtuous sorrow clouds the face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tears bedim the eye;<br />
The soul is led to solemn thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wafted to the sky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>The new
board school was opened May 27th of this year, Mr. Gray,
master.</p>
<p>James Knights, the elder, died the latter end of May.&nbsp;
His son John died on the 2nd of August, aged 56 years; he had
been for many weeks afflicted.&nbsp; My good old neighbour, Mrs.
Phebe Adams, died at Yarmouth, at the house of her younger son
Alfred, on the 16th of October, aged 86 years (this was the
fortieth anniversary of my marriage).&nbsp; She was brought to
Oulton and laid beside her husband who had died eight years
earlier.&nbsp; Mr. Woolterton (called Dr.) had resided here about
twenty years, and departed this life on the 17th of October, aged
32 years, and was buried at Oulton.&nbsp; Two more of my
neighbours are called away: David Bullen, on the 15th of August,
1879, aged 82 years, after a long affliction; and also Mrs. High,
on the 21st of August, also after years of suffering, aged 78
years.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou turnest man to destruction, again thou
sayest come again ye children of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the autumn of the past year Mr. Robertson and his
tenant built sheds and piggeries adjoining my dwelling.&nbsp; I
stated my disapproval thereof, and requested that a course of
bricks should be put up, as nothing short of that would keep me
quiet, as rats from his side had found their way under the floor
of my bedroom.&nbsp; He did not meet my views, and I thereupon
told Mr. Robertson I should take down my wall and it would be
placed twenty-one inches from his line of boundary; and so it
came to pass for on the 29th of April, 1879, I proceeded to take
down the wall and built another more substantial, and now the
rats are kept back from troubling on my side, and having raised
my roof and made chambers over, I have not regretted the
inflexibility of my neighbour, for although he has fixed boarding
to intercept my view on that side, yet there is plenty of light
and air from the other, and the additional conveniences more than
compensate for the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>outlay, and thus we see working for good many things
that at a first glance wears a very unfavourable aspect.&nbsp; My
dear wife has fallen into a state of affliction, and is being
attended by Mr. Smith, of Carlton.&nbsp; She is able to get
about, but almost shattered by a dreadful wrecking cough, her
niece came to attend upon her, but it soon became evident that
her end was approaching as the medicines and applications had but
little effect.&nbsp; Early on Sunday morning the 3rd of August, a
dreadful thunderstorm came on; being greatly alarmed I sprang up
in sleep and asked the poor sufferer what was it that had fallen
down, she replied that nothing had fallen but that it was a sharp
tempest.&nbsp; It proved to be indeed severe, the Church at
Wells, in Norfolk, was struck and wrecked at the same time.&nbsp;
She lived exactly four weeks after that event, lingering on until
the morning of Sunday, the 31st of August, at half-past four
o&rsquo;clock, when she breathed her last, having been married
forty years and ten months, twenty-seven years of which she had
been mistress of the village school, which office she
relinquished when the newly-established board school came into
operation, in May of the preceding year.&nbsp; Another of my
neighbours, Hannah Patrick, died suddenly two days after my wife,
her husband, William, surviving her about six months, when he
also died and was brought from London and buried.&nbsp; On the
6th of January, 1880, two other of my aged neighbours were called
away: Richard Rowe, many years station master here, and John
Pinkney who lived and died near the church, where his body now
rests.&nbsp; Another visitation befel the town of Wells, a
terrible gale occurred on the 29th of October, the lifeboat had
gone off to the attempted rescue of a vessel in distress, that
boat capsized and nearly all its occupants were drowned, beside a
great many others who were cut off by the violence of the storm,
among the latter was one whom we called Captain Hiles, whom I had
many times met in the house of prayer, when he was ashore, and on
the last <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>Sabbath of his life was engaged in exhorting sinners and
warning them to fly to Jesus for pardon and salvation.</p>
<p>The few weeks with which the past year closed were remarkably
mild, and sometimes pleasant gentleness marked the passing
year.&nbsp; The year 1881 was ushered in mild, and we were
beginning to think that the time for sharp weather was getting
past for the season, when lo! on the 18th of January, a violent
gale from the east with almost blinding snow set in during the
evening, the intensity of the frost was almost unparalleled,
almost to freeze the blood in the veins of those who were exposed
to its fury.&nbsp; Deplorable was the destruction and loss of
life on the Eastern coast; at Yarmouth the lifeboat was capsized,
and nearly all her brave men drowned, together with a shipwrecked
sailor whom they had taken off from a stranded vessel.&nbsp; The
visitation will be long and sorrowfully remembered by the
inhabitants of Yarmouth and its vicinity.&nbsp; Before the month
had passed away and while many embankments of snow continued even
after the thaw had set in, another of my neighbours, George
Bullen, the eldest son of David, is called to his rest, on the
26th of January.&nbsp; He had been many months afflicted, and
during his long illness many prayers were offered to the Lord on
his behalf, that he might obtain pardon and peace and lively hope
through our Lord Jesus Christ, which we believe was realized.</p>
<p>During the second month of this year, 1881, the elder Mrs.
Wright who had resided in Oulton more than thirty years, died on
the 13th of February, at the advanced age of 86 years.&nbsp;
During the third month of this year, the elder Mrs. Susan Farman
died, on the 9th day of March, aged 79 years, having resided in
Oulton fifty years.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s portion is his
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the fourth month another of my elder neighbours was
called away, Francis Harper, having <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>resided in Oulton about forty years,
a quiet, good, honest, and honourable man; served his generation
by the will of God, fell on sleep March the 15th.&nbsp; Another
neighbour, Mrs. Elizabeth Reynolds, wife of Thomas, who with her
husband were the only unbroken pair that were living as paired
when I was married, all the other pairs were broken or swept
away.&nbsp; Mrs. Reynolds died on the 2nd of April, aged 76
years.</p>
<p>Next, here is a record of an honourable marriage, which is
worthy of note, April 7th, at the Congregational Chapel, Beccles,
by the Pastor, J. Calvert, assisted by S. B. Driver, pastor of
the Congregational Chapel, Lowestoft, Mr. M. Hinde, of Lowestoft,
to Louisa, daughter of the late James Read, farmer and valuer of
Laxfield, Suffolk.</p>
<p>The Earl of Beaconsfield, a distinguished statesman, who had
filled the high and honourable office of Prime Minister of
England, and confidential adviser of Her Majesty, died in London,
April 19th, at the age of 75 years, a large profusion of flowers
being dropt upon his tomb.</p>
<h2><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Appendix.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1877, the Pakefield
Friendly Society came to an end, having fought its way fifty-two
years, and having survived the Vicar of Lowestoft fourteen
years.&nbsp; Mr. Cunningham had from the first taken a deep
interest in that institution, and greatly contributed to its
prosperity.</p>
<p>I was proposed and accepted as one of its stewards in 1840,
and continued to serve the office until its dissolution (37
years), the funds then being distributed among the members in
sums ranging from &pound;2 12s. 8d., to &pound;20 13s. 8d., about
155 members partaking of this final benefit, although I am not
sure they were all satisfied, yet the various awards were carried
out very fair and impartially.&nbsp; As to myself I received a
present from the directors, through Mr. Seppings, the secretary
and that Gentleman also made me a money present.&nbsp; I resolved
therewith to buy some books in remembrance of the above Society,
that I might read them in days to come, among others I purchased
&ldquo;Goldsmith&rsquo;s Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo; and on
reading it came across some of the chapters which I remembered to
have read nearly sixty years before, and do not recollect meeting
with the book in all that long interval, although I had seen it
advertised.&nbsp; I thought I would one day catch hold of
it.&nbsp; The above work is said to be &ldquo;a domestic
epic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its hero is a country parson, simple and pious
in his way, a little vain of his learning, and a little proud of
his fine family.&nbsp; Domestic joys and cares surround the
parsonage, then in turn comes sorrow and <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>suffering,
storms from the outer world invade its holiness and trouble its
peace.&nbsp; Then comes sorrow and suffering, and we behold the
hero, like the patriarchal prince of the land of Uz, when the
Lord &ldquo;put forth is hand and touched all that he had,&rdquo;
meeting each new affliction with meekness patience and
resignation; rising from each trial with renewed reliance upon
God, until the lowest depth of his earthly suffering becomes the
highest elevation of his moral strength, preminently conspicious
by the indwelling and powerful influence of God&rsquo;s Holy
Spirit,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is the grace that lives and sings,<br
/>
When other comforts cease.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember in early life in the year 1816, at the time I
attended school, a great festival was held in commemoration of
the triumph of Waterloo.&nbsp; I carried home from school an
invitation card to my parents, which ran thus (after naming)
&ldquo;you are invited to appear at the table at one
o&rsquo;clock on &mdash; day next, perfectly neat, with your
family, and bring your half-pint mug, plate, knife and
fork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invitations were well received, the festival was truly
appreciated, the plum puddings and other good things were greatly
enjoyed, a long length of painted calico extended from one large
tree to another, with these mottoes in large letters,
&ldquo;Peace to Europe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Glory to God,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Deliverance to Mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remember also to
have had a printed paper exhibited in front of my cap with the
ominous words &ldquo;Peace and Plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But perhaps the crowning scene of that day&rsquo;s festivities
was the effigy of the fallen Emperor of France, seated on a
chair, secured prominently upon the roof of Ben Thompson&rsquo;s
cottage, in an attitude of sorrow, with his Hessian boots to the
knee, his cocked hat on his head, the uniform of a superior
commanding officer, with white handkerchief to his eyes, and <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>looking the
picture of fallen greatness, no longer to dictate laws to an
infatuated and misguided people, whose time of reckoning had
come.</p>
<p>The spring of 1854 was remarkably dry, no rain came during the
months of March and April, many farmers could not get their corn
in, and those who did so it could not germinate, by reason of the
long continued drought.&nbsp; It was a serious onlook when the
grass by the roadside was covered with dust and withering; the
wind fresh and sharp from the northeast, week after week,
sometimes a little moisture came resembling mildew, and
altogether we seemed to be in a serious plight; in this emergency
on one calm evening in the early part of May, I went into the
field just across from my dwelling, turned to the fence where the
railroad has since been made, and there knelt down and besought
the Lord that he would be merciful to our transgressions, be
favourable to our land, forgive our iniquities, though we had
sinned against Him, yet spare us good Lord, O send us the so
much-needed rain, and be not angry with us for ever.</p>
<p>The wind began to freshen and blow from another quarter, the
vanes of the windmill began to creak and turn round, the sails
thereof quickly went about from the north east to the south, and
in the short space of twenty four hours, which was on the 9th of
May, the earth was abundantly watered.&nbsp; Here then was
manifested the bestowment of a great blessing in answer to
prayer.</p>
<p>I had noted it down as a <i>glorious rain</i>, and I will also
add the position of the mill was changing before I rose from off
my knees.&nbsp; But I have always considered there were many
others who were so engaged, whose petitions moved the hand that
moves the world.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>I am
also reminded being now upon the subject of prayer, that during
the year 1849, that fearful epidemic called the cholera, had
again visited our country; it was computed that more than
fourteen thousand were carried off by its virulence in London,
and coming nearer home great alarm prevailed in Lowestoft and
other places at the approach of such a visitation, many were cut
off in this latter place, among whom were Mrs. John Capps, and
also one of her married daughters, Mrs. Cooper, both of whom it
is believed were prepared for the solemn change.&nbsp; I had on
one occasion feared that it had visited my cottage; my poor wife
was attacked in bed with fearful pain, she complained of its
violence and concluded it was an attack of cholera.&nbsp; I arose
and brought to hand what we had in order to alleviate the pain,
and then exhorted her to pray to God that he would be merciful
unto us for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake, I also knelt down by the
bedside and prayed for mercy on behalf of the sufferer.&nbsp; The
good Lord heard our joint petitions and after a not very long
time, relief came, the pain abated, and our thankful hearts were
attuned to praise the Lord, and the life of the sufferer was not
merely lengthened out fifteen years as was good Hezekiah&rsquo;s
after his afflictions, but exactly that number twice told.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lord is merciful and gracious, abounding in compassion
unto such as fear and adore and reverence his great and holy
name.&rdquo;&nbsp; This morning, Sunday, May the 8th, one of the
first thoughts that entered my mind was a sentence referring to
rest, and for a time seemed to wonder if it was a quotation
contained in God&rsquo;s Holy Word, when while I was dressing it
came into my mind that it is the language of St. Paul to the
church at Thessalonica, and so it proved, 2 <i>Thess.</i> i. 6,
7.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
recompense tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you who
are troubled, rest with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is then a joyful
communication imparted to every one who can appreciate the
comfort of it, and it is an uncontroverted <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>fact that all
God&rsquo;s children here in this time-state, shall have
persecution of various kinds: of vituperations, of false
accusation, and almost every other kind of unrest, but the
apostle&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;rest with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion I desire to feel thankful to my Heavenly Father,
by whose favour health has been continued, and although my
eyesight is becoming very much impaired, and my hand almost
inflexible, yet I have endeavoured to state a plain narrative of
facts, not entirely as mere passing events, at which one might
cast a casual glance and then continue to journey on the other
side, affording no sympathy to our afflicted fellow-creatures in
seasons of grief and distress.&nbsp; I am here reminded that I
lost a sister-in-law by death: Maria, the wife of John Garner, of
Lowestoft, on the nineteenth of July, 1858, aged 40 years.&nbsp;
Also more recent by death, one of my own sisters, Charlotte, the
wife of James Lines, of Hoxne, born December 1st, 1810, died
December 21st, 1880.&nbsp; May the Spirit of God stir up the
heart of the writer of these lines, as well as the readers
thereof, to a fuller sense of the love of Him, &ldquo;who though
he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we through his
poverty might be rich.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henceforth let us not be
weary in well doing, but be &ldquo;followers of them who through
faith and patience inherit the promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, who hast
loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good
hope, through grace, comfort your hearts and stablish you in
every good word and work,&rdquo; so will <i>I</i> sing praise
unto thy name for ever and ever, Amen.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
